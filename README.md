* This is a sample student Software Engineering for delivery drivers to manage their orders efficiently.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a delivery driver for a logistic company looking to better manage their work schedule
  * as a delivery driver for an F&B shop looking to better manage their food delivery operations
  
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TimeforWheels_) used for managing delivery orders.
  * It is **written in Java OOP fashion**. 
* It is named `TimeforWheels` since the goal of the app is to help delivey drivers better manage their time.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TimeforWheels Developer Guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w10-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)**.
* For Users who want to know how to use the app, see the **[TimeforWheels User Guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w10-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
