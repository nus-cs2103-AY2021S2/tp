### Weeblingo
Weeblingo is a desktop app for managing flashcards, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With a nice and friendly interface,
users can learn Japanese at a comfortable pace with this application.

#### Feature List
- start \- shows the first flashcard (eg. [あ])
- check \- gives answer to previously shown flashcard (eg. [ a ])
- next \- only entered after show or check, goes to next flashcard (eg. [ い ])
- list \- lists out all flashcards available as a formatted String (eg. {(あ, a), (い, i), (う, u), (え, e), (お, o)})
- end \- ends current flashcard session
- exit \- exits the application
- help \- displays help, input command for specific help
