* The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

* The Food Diary will allow students to save time and effort when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity.
