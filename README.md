* This is the CS2103T Project for **Team CS2103T-W10-2**, the name of the project is StoreMando.

* StoreMando is an integrated platform fully customised for residents in households, residential colleges and halls, to
  help users manage their items effectively and efficiently. StoreMando allows users to keep track of their items'
  whereabouts, quantities and expiry dates with a few simple commands. Furthermore, StoreMando also comes with an
  inbuilt reminder feature to help users keep track of items that are expiring. All items' information is encapsulated
  clearly on our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI). Our application is optimised for use via the Command
  Line Interface (CLI) and if users have quick fingers, StoreMando can help users manage their items in the blink of an
  eye.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see
  the **[StoreMando Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/)**.
