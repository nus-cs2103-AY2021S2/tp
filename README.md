This is a sample project for Managers of Tuition Centres
Example usages:
- To allocate students and tutors to a specific session
- Manage students, tutors and sessions all in one platform

The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called EzManage) used for
managing students, tutors and sessions.
- It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules,
  without being overwhelmingly big.
- It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.

It is named as EzManage as it allows tuition centres managers to easily manage
students, tutors and sessions all in one single web application.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [EzManage product website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103-w16-4.github.io/tp/).
This project is a part of the se-education.org initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see se-education.org for more info.
