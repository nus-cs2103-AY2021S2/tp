* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  
* This is **project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Car@leads_) <br>
  used for managing car customers contacts .
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** <br>
    (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Car@leads` because we want car salesperson users to match their cars with the right customers.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Car@leads Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w12-2.github.io/tp/)**.
