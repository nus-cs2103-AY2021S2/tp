* This is **Module Planning App project for NUS students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a personalised module planner for an NUS student
  * as a platform to check whether graduation criteria is met
* The project allows NUS students to be able to plan for their modules to take in their future semesters by ensuring that their pre-requisites are met and that the modules taken are able to meet their graduation requirements.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[NUS Module Planner Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103-w17-1.github.io/tp/)**.
