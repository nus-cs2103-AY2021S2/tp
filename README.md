* HeliBook is a **desktop app for managing your childrenâ€™s contacts**.
* It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HeliBook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* It is named `HeliBook` because it is designed to be an address book for helicopter parents.  A helicopter parent is a parent who takes an overprotective or excessive interest in the life of their child or children.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HeliBook Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w13-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the **AddressBook-Level3 project** created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
