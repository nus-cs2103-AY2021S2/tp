## Introduction

imPoster contains most of the features of [postman](https://www.postman.com/)
and is implemented in a simple and minimalistic style that is easy for anyone to
pick up. The latest releases for download are available on our
[main website](https://imposter-dev.tk).

## Features

imPoster runs locally on your computer and simplifies the process of
building/testing an API. We offer support for the following tasks:

1. Create, send and save API requests
2. View status code, response size, and response time
3. View response headers
4. View response body in pretty or raw view
5. Save response to a file.

For more details on the features and their usage, please refer to the
[user guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).
