* This is **TutorsPet**.<br>
  * Target user: Tuition teachers <br>
  * Usage: Manage and categorise contacts of students and their guardians
  * Goal: To improve efficiency and reduce confusion when tutors are tracking students' information
  
* The project evolves the `AddressBook-Level3` (`AB3` for short) into a more powerful or more optimized contact management app.
  * `AB3` is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * `AB3` comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named `TutorsPet` because it aims to facilitate a tutor's management of students' information.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TutorsPet Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-t11-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on `AB3` project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
