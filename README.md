CoLAB (Command Line Address Book) is a **desktop app for students currently enrolled in a university to manage their school projects.** It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CoLAB can get your project management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
