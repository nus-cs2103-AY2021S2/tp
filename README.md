* This is a **Software Engineering (SE) project by students**, which aims to **help insurance agents manage their huge numbers of clients through a desktop application** (called _ClientBook_).
* Example usages:
  * Insurance agents can easily manage (_add_, _search_, _edit_, _delete_) their client's contacts in this application.
  * Insurance agents can add remarks or notes about things they need to remember about a particular client.
  * Insurance agents can include clients' portfolio ID in their clients' contact profile too.
* For the detailed documentation of this application, see our **[User Guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see our **[Developer Guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)**.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
