SmartLib is a desktop app for managing libraries and private book loaning services owning less than 10,000 books,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, SmartLib would be a brilliant and efficient assistant in the systematic management of your books
and borrowers' information, as compared to the traditional GUI apps currently available in the market.
