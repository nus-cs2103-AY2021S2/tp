## About ResidenceTracker<br>
ResidenceTracker is a command line based desktop application that assists landlords in managing their residences that they are listing out on the Airbnb platform for rent.

* It gives user convenience by providing a centralised overview of all the user's residences and the respective bookingList/cleaning statuses of each residence.

* It uses a **quick CLI** way to note down bookings and track status of different residence, such as
  clean or needs cleaning/booked or available, so the landlord can process bookings more efficiently and inform the cleaning agent as necessary before the next lease arrives.

* It is **written in OOP fashion**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* For more details on ResidenceTracker, please refer to our [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md).
