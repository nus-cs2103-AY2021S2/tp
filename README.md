ClientBook is an application for insurance agents to manage client contacts, optimized for use with just a keyboard,
but still offering a graphical interface for ease of viewing of client contacts. The purpose of ClientBook is to help
insurance agents who can type fast to accomplish their client management tasks faster than traditional applications.
