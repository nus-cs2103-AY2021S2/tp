## **Introduction**
imPoster is a desktop application for beginners of API development to quickly grasp the basics. 
imPoster's simple and minimalistic style can help beginner API developers **explore** and **test** APIs, whether those **found online** or those that they have **built** themselves.
imPoster is also highly optimised fast typists and can be fully operated through keyboard commands. <br>

This developer's guide assumes its readers to have a **basic understanding** of APIs. 
For a basic definition of [what an API is](#what-is-an-api), an appendix has been provided for readers who may be unfamiliar with the concept.
However, it is highly recommended for readers to refer to proper tutorial contents for the basics of APIs prior to developing the application. <br>

Readers are also advised to download our latest releases from our [main website](https://imposter-dev.tk) in order to test out the application. <br>

## **Navigating this Developer Guide**

Before diving into the rest of the contents in our developer guide, the following are a few important syntaxes to take note of to facilitate your reading:

## **Design**
### Architecture
<p align="center">
  <img width="450px" src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" >
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/Main.java) and [`ImPoster`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/ImPoster.java). They are responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 1`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramRemove.png" >
</p>

The sections on the next few pages will give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component
<p align="center">
  <img width="900px" src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" >
</p>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EndpointListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in 
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component
<p align="center">
  <img width="900px" src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" >
</p>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ImposterParser` class to parse the user command
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a endpoint).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remove 1")` API call.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
<p align="center">
  <img width="450px" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" >
</p>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the Endpoint List Data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Endpoint>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model
is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `imPoster`, which `Endpoint` references. This allows `imPoster` to only 
require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Endpoint` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
</div>
<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" >
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component
<p align="center">
  <img width="900px" src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" >
</p>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Endpoint List data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.us.among.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Endpoint components

* Change/Add classes in the Endpoint package to encapsulate an API endpoint.

#### Implementation
<p align="center">
  <img width="650px" src="images/EndpointClassDiagram.png" >
</p>

An `Endpoint`,
* is stored in `EndpointList` of the `Model`
* encapsulates an API endpoint

An `Endpoint` contains the following attributes:
1. a `Method`, which represents the type of request an API endpoint will send to the server
2. an `Address`, which represents the URL address to which the API request is made
3. a `Data`, which represents the data that is to be sent to the server when an API request is made
4. a Headers Set, which encapsulates a list of zero or more `Header` objects, where each `Header` represents a header that is to be sent to the server
5. a Tags Set, which encapsulates a list of zero or more `Tags` objects
6. a `Response`, which represents the response that an API receives from the server

* There are a certain set of requests that an API can make: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH.
* A `Method` object will always be one of the above requests
* `Data` represents the data that is to be sent to the server when an API request is made
* `Data` can be empty, as some API calls do not send any data to the server
* Before an API call is made, the `Response` object will be empty
* Only when a `Request#executeTimed(request)` is called will a `Response` contain information about the API call response

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect: How the components within `Endpoint` are added or changed
* **Current Choice**: Attributes within `Endpoint` are immutable, meaning that if there is an attribute that has to be
  edited or added, a new Endpoint object has to be created.
    * Pros: Concept of Immutability is met, making the code less prone to bugs as all components of an Endpoint object are fixed
    * Cons: Less flexible, more steps needed in creating or editing Endpoint objects

* **Alternative 1**: Allow certain components within `Endpoint`, like `Header` and `Data` to be mutable
    * Pros: Less overhead as fewer objects are created
    * Cons: Prone to error as a Component might not be correctly changed
    
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add endpoint feature

#### What it is

Adds an endpoint to the bottom of the list of currently existing endpoints. Users are able to add any valid endpoint to the list. If the exact same endpoint is already in the list, this command will not be allowed and an error will be shown.

Example: `add -x get -u google.com`

#### Implementation

Upon the users entry of the endpoint, the `AddCommand` object is created. `AddCommand` is a class that extends `Command` abstract class. `AddCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the method will add the given endpoint in the model's list of endpoints if a valid endpoint is given.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `add -x get -u google.com` to save an endpoint.

Step 2. The endpoint is added to the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

<p align="center">
  <img width="900px" src="images/AddSequenceDiagram.png" >
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find command feature

#### What it is

Looks for an endpoint in the list of endpoints and displays all the endpoints that match the requested specifications. If there are no specifications, `find` will do a general search through all fields that endpoint has.

#### Implementation

Upon the users entry of the find keyword, the parser will check if prefixes have been specified, if the user decided to specify prefixes, the `FindCommand` object will be created with predicates looking through the specified prefixes. Else, a general endpoint predicate that will scan through all fields of endpoint will be created. `FindCommand` is a class that extends `Command` abstract class. `FindCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the method will search through the given endpoints in the model's list of endpoints and check if any endpoints match the specifications. It will then update the model with the filtered endpoint list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `find -x get -u google.com` to find an endpoint.

Step 2. The find command will check and see if there are any endpoints that contain the method `get` and the address `google.com` using the `Model#updateFilteredEndpointList` method.

Step 3. `Model#updateFilteredEndpointList` will be called and model will be updated.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `find get` will work as well, but will look through all fields instead of just one
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a valid find command:

<p align="center">
  <img width="430px" src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" >
</p>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `find` checks for keywords in the prefix fields, if there are no prefixes present, it will perform a general search using a `EndPointContainsKeywordsPredicate` which looks through all fields in endpoint. Else the method, `ArgumentMultimap#arePrefixesPresent` will check and return a new predicate for each value after each prefix if it is present and then generate a keyword predicate that will match values in that field. Each predicate uses a partial keyword search hence, the user does not need to type in the full word for any find searches.
  * Pros: By abstracting out the `Predicate` method and encapsulating the validation, these predicates can be used elsewhere if needed to match endpoints.
  * Cons: An extra layer of abstraction may make it harder to make quick changes if new prefixes are added.

* **Alternative 2:** Directly check for the validity of the endpoints in the find command parser without going through a predicate.
  * Pros: Developers will have an easier time understanding the code and how find command works, since all of the code will be kept in find command, making changes will be easier.
  * Cons: Duplication of code may occur and bad coding practices may arise due to lack of abstraction.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Send & run command feature

#### What it is

Allows the user to make a request to a specific API endpoint, either with data from a saved endpoint (`send` command) or values passed in from the command box (`run` command). The main use cases for send and run commands are as follows:
* Send: the user wants to get the latest response from the API service provider of a particular endpoint in the endpoint list. The endpoint invoked will also update its response details in the storage file.
* Run: the user wants to run a quick API request without saving. The parameters required for the API request is supplied as part of the command parameters, and the response will be displayed for inspection.

#### Implementation

The send and run commands both involve the invocation of an actual outbound request that is facilitated by the `request` package. Both commands allow users to get the latest response from an endpoint and display the result for inspection.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the `run` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `run -x get -u https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/air-temperature` to make a call to the specified API (which is a `get` request to the URL above).

Step 2. The `run` command parser first validates the user input. According to the format of the run command supplied, the parser retrieves the relevant endpoint details in order to construct a `run` command.

Step 3. The `run` command creates an `EndpointCaller` object to execute the request via `EndpointCaller#callEndpoint()`, sending out the HTTP request to the targeted API service provider and retrieves a response.

Step 4. The response will then be parsed and forwarded to `UI` for further formatting before displaying to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a run command fails to execute, relevant error message will be provided.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `run` operation works:

<p align="center">
  <img width="900px" src="images/RunSequenceDiagram.png" >
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for 
`RunCommandParser`, `RunCommand` and `EndpointCaller` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation 
of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a valid run command:
<p align="center">
  <img width="375px" src="images/RunActivityDiagram.png" >
</p>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How run executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `run` command parser does a primitive verification of the url via
  the helper method `ParserUtil#parseAddress`. The helper method in term invokes `Address#isValidAddress` to
  intercept obvious non-urls provided by the user. The parser thereafter generates a `run` command with the verified
  input.
  * Pros: By abstracting out the `parseAddress` method and encapsulating the validity of URL address in the `Address`
    class, the helper method can be utilised by other commands such as the `add` command.
  * Cons: An extra layer of abstraction may make it harder to make quick changes to the logic in URL address
    verification.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command parser checks for the url address validity by itself.
  * Pros: Making it obvious to developers to view the exact steps taken in parsing the user input within
    each command parser.
  * Cons: Duplication of code across all command parsers that require the verification of URLs, such as `add` and
    `run` commands.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Request feature

#### What it is

Supports the core functionality of our product which involves the sending of requests and receiving of responses from a specified endpoint. Required by the `send` and `run` command to perform API calls as requested by the user.

#### Implementation

The request mechanism is invoked by the `EndpointCaller` object when the user executes a send/run command and is facilitated by the `Apache HttpComponents` library. When invoked, it performs an API call to a specific endpoint and returns a response if the call is performed successfully. It supports API calls for the following methods, each represented by a class:
- `GET`
- `PUT`
- `POST`
- `DELETE`
- `HEAD`
- `OPTIONS`
- `PATCH`

Given below is an example usage scenario where the behaviour of request mechanism is captured in step 3.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time which comes with a default list of endpoints.

Step 2. The user executes `send 1` command. The endpoint at the first index will then be used to generate an `EndpointCaller` object.

Step 3. The `send` command calls `EndpointCaller#callEndpoint()`, which in turn calls `EndpointCaller#sendRequest`. Next, a `GetRequest` object is created for the associated endpoint and its `send` method is invoked. Following this, a `HttpUriRequest` object is created and `Headers` and `Data` fields are populated with values retrieved from the endpoint. Finally, the `#execute` method from the abstract `Request` class is called and a timed execution of the API call is carried out to the targeted API service provider. A response is returned and the existing endpoint used to invoke the request will be updated with the returned response and saved into the model.

Step 4. The response retrieved will also be parsed and passed to UI for further formatting and displaying to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If an API call fails to return a response (e.g. due to connection error), it will not call `model.setEndpoint()` so the endpoint list state will not be updated or saved.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the request operation works when a user executes a `send` command for an endpoint with a `GET` request:

<p align="center">
  <img width="500px" src="images/RequestSequenceDiagram.png" >
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SendCommand`, `EndpointCaller` and `GetRequest` should end 
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `send` command for an endpoint with a `GET` request:<br/>

<p align="center">
  <img width="430px" img alt="RequestActivityDiagram" src="images/RequestActivityDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How request executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A request class is inherited by classes representing the various types of supported HTTP request methods.
    * Pros: Common operations are abstracted out into the request class which improves code reusability and is easily extensible to support new methods.
    * Cons: Introduces a tightly coupled relationship between the request class and its child classes as changing the request class may affect all its child classes.

* **Alternative 2:** Each HTTP request method is represented by a single class that does not inherit from a request class.
    * Pros: Less coupling between the request classes where the logic for each HTTP method is handled independently.
    * Cons: Common operations are repeated in each of the method class leading to significant code duplications.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Toggle command feature

#### What it is

Allows the user to switch between supported themes (colour palettes) within the product.

#### Implementation

Upon entry of the toggle command, it is parsed to check if the input theme is valid (ie. among the list of available themes). If it is valid, a `ToggleCommand` is created. `ToggleCommand` is a class that extends the `Command` class and hence also inherits the `execute()` method. When `execute()` is called, it will set the theme of the application to be the input theme.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the toggle command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `toggle light` to change the application theme to the light theme.

Step 2. The `toggle` command returns a `CommandResult` that triggers the `updateTheme()` method within `MainWindow`. `MainWindow` then finds the relevant .css file containing all theme information and applies it to all elements it contains.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the toggle command works for the above example: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ToggleSequenceDiagram.png" >
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ToggleCommand`, `ToggleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

## **Appendix F: Developer Workflow**
 
Please checkout the [workflow guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/WorkflowGuide.html) to understand
the adopted approach in maintaining imPoster.

## **Appendix G: API definition**

### What is an API?
Broadly speaking, an **API** is an interface that enables and defines how **two systems** interact with one another.Â In a classic analogy, the interaction above is usually likened to a **waiter** communicating a **customer** order to the restaurant **kitchen**. In this analogy, the **customer** and **kitchen** represents the **two systems** and the **waiter** represents the **API** allowing them to communicate. The **order** and **food** delivered then corresponds to the terms **request** and **response** associated with an API call. The annotated diagram below captures these interactions and may aid in providing a better understanding:

<p align="center">
  <img width="700px" src="images/ApiExplanation.png" >
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Why learn about APIs?

You may be surprised to know that APIs are not only widely used in our daily lives, it is also likely that you have been using them frequently without actually noticing them! For example, the simple act of visiting a website involves an API request which is responsible for bringing back a response to you in the form of a webpage. Even a simple text message to your friend relies on an API to reliably deliver your message! The use of APIs is extensive in todayâ€™s highly connected world so even if they are completely unrelated to your job, it helps to have some basic understanding of them!

      Other incorrect remove commands to try: `run x` (where x is any URL whose connection cannot be established).

### Saving data

1. Saving endpoints between sessions
   
   1. Launch the app.
      
   1. Save an endpoint with a valid `add` command. Confirm the endpoint has been saved by checking its existence at the end of the list of saved endpoints.
      
   1. Close the app.
      
   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      Expected: The new endpoint is still present at the end of the list of saved endpoints.

1. Dealing with corrupted/missing data files

   1. Prerequisite: Have opened and closed the application and confirmed that the files `preferences.json` and `data/imposter.json` have been created in the same directory that imPoster was run from.
      
   1. Manually edit any of the aforementioned files with any text editing software to break the JSON format. For example, removing the opening curly brace of the JSON file. Alternatively, you may delete these files.
      
   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
    
   1. Test case: `data/imposter.json` was corrupted. <br>
      Expected: The app starts with a list of saved endpoints (on the left) that is empty.
      
   1. Test case: `data/imposter.json` was deleted. <br>
      Expected: The app starts with the default list of saved endpoints.
      
   1. Test case: `preferences.json` was corrupted/deleted. <br>
      Expected: The app starts with the default theme, window size and location.

### Toggle the theme

1. Toggle the theme

   1. Test case: `toggle imposter` <br>
      Expected: Theme changes to the `imposter` theme.

   1. Test case: `toggle material` <br>
      Expected: Theme changes to the `material` theme.

   1. Test case: `toggle dark` <br>
      Expected: Theme changes to the `dark` theme.

   1. Test case: `toggle light` <br>
      Expected: Theme changes to the `light` theme.

   1. Test case: `toggle` <br>
      Expected: Theme is not changed. Error details shown in the result display, with a result message saying `Invalid command format!...`.

   1. Test case: `toggle abc` <br>
      Expected: Theme is not changed. Error details shown in the result display, with a result message saying `You may only toggle to supported themes...`.
       
### Opening help window

1. Opening help window

   1. Test case: `help` <br>
      Expected: Help window with command examples and helpful links appears.
      
   1. Test case: `help thisisarandomstring` <br>
      Expected: Help window appears.

**Logic**

TheÂ LogicÂ of imPoster was evolvedÂ to become more complex than that of the original address book.Â While for the AB3, its core functionality focused on adding and maintaining of contacts, imPoster took it a step further by requiring support for the sending and receiving of requests and responses.

As such, to provide for this new functionality, on top of refactoring the `Person` model into an `Endpoint`, the logic for calling an endpoint also had to be written from scratch. As there wereÂ numerous approaches that can be taken to include this logic, experimenting to find the best approach turned out to be a long process that took significant time and effort as we also had to look out for possible issues that may arise from regressions.

Eventually, we settled with an implementation that involved having to make an APIÂ call on a thread as well as used a GIF toÂ indicate an API call in-progress. Such an approach was undertaken after we realised that extended API calls had the tendency to freeze up the UI of the application and is just one of the many issues that we had to resolve and adapt to along the way.

The implementation of this request feature is also done in an OOP fashion, where the request logic is abstracted out in a `Request` class and then inherited by subclasses whichÂ represent the different HTTP request methods.

**UI**

TheÂ UI of imPoster was evolved to be slightly more complex than that of the original address book. This is because due to the nature of our application (which involved the receiving of API responses), we needed a much larger result display that was able to show more information.

As none of our team members had any experience with JavaFX prior to this module, tampering around with the UI required significant effort. The UI also had to be frequently revisited as we continued with other aspects of implementation for our project. For example, when the request feature was being worked on, a GIF had to be shown to the user to indicate an API call in-progress, along with a GIF that accompanied error messages. On top of that, additional prettifying of JSON responses also had to be done for information to be shown neatly to the users. To prevent cluttering of the result display, several information were also chosen to be displayed as smaller neat tags at the top of the result display panel.

Eventually, the team got more comfortable with working on the UI and to that end, an easily extensible feature was also implemented for the UI through the `toggle` command (which supported the switching of application theme for our users). The implementation of the `toggle` command allowed for new themes to be added through merely adding the name of the new theme in an enum as well as its corresponding css file.
