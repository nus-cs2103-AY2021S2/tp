### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram of StoreMando](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of
each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML
Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit
diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and
exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

![Sequence Diagram of the Architecture](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `StoreMandoParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an item).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
   help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the StoreMando data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Item>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the StoreMando data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.storemando.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedStoreMando`. It extends `StoreMando` with undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `storeMandoStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedStoreMando#commit()` — Saves the current inventory state in its history.
* `VersionedStoreMando#undo()` — Restores the previous inventory state from its history.
* `VersionedStoreMando#redo()` — Restores a previously undone inventory state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitStoreMando()`, `Model#undoStoreMando()`
and `Model#redoStoreMando()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedStoreMando` will be initialized with the
initial inventory state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single inventory state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th item in the inventory. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitStoreMando()`, causing the modified state of the inventory after the `delete 5` command executes to
be saved in the `storeMandoStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted inventory state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new item. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitStoreMando()`,
causing another modified inventory state to be saved into the `storeMandoStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitStoreMando()`, so the inventory state will not be saved into the `storeMandoStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the item was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo`
command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoStoreMando()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the
left, pointing it to the previous inventory state, and restores the inventory to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial StoreMando state, then there are no previous StoreMando states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoStoreMando()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoStoreMando()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to
the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the inventory to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `storeMandoStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest inventory state, then there are no undone StoreMando states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoStoreMando()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the inventory, such as `list`,
will usually not call `Model#commitStoreMando()`, `Model#undoStoreMando()` or `Model#redoStoreMando()`. Thus,
the `storeMandoStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitStoreMando()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `storeMandoStateList`, all inventory states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop
applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire inventory.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the item being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

* [Configuration guide](Configuration.md)
* [DevOps guide](DevOps.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* household resident
* has a lot of items at home and cannot constantly keep track of their respective locations
* has a lot of perishable items with various expiry dates that are difficult to remember
* prefers desktop applications over other types
* fast typist
* prefers typing to using mouse 
* comfortable using CLI applications

**Value proposition**: Every info of every item you have at home - all in one place. One command is all you have to key 
in to add, delete or find for an item. StoreMando keeps track of everything you need so that you don't have to 
physically search for an item to obtain information on it. Get everything you need from StoreMando - locations,
quantities and expiry dates.

### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a …​ | I want to …​ | So that I can…​ | 
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ | 
| `* * *` | user | add an item to the inventory | keep track of it’s location, quantity and expiry date |
| `* * *` | user who discards items often | delete an item from the inventory | remove it when it is expired or used up |
| `* * *` | user who stocks up items regularly | update my items’ details | change the items' expiry dates and/or quantities accordingly | 
| `* * *` | user with many items | list down all items | know all the items I have in one glance |
| `* *` | user who has many items in my room | see all items in my room | keep track of exactly what I have | 
| `* *` | user who tags my items meaningfully | see all items with the same tag | see what items I have with that particular tag |
| `* * *` | forgetful user with many items | search for an item quickly | locate them easily |
| `* *` | forgetful user | be aware of my expiring items | replace them before it is expired or discard them if they have expired |
| `* *` | grocery buyer of the household | sort my items in terms of quantity | stock up items that are running low on quantity |
| `* *` | user who does not like to waste food | sort my food in terms of expiry date | consume food that is expiring first |
| `*` | user who discards large number of items at once | clear all the items in the inventory | start the list afresh without having waste time deleting each item manually |
| `*` | user who does room cleaning during CNY | clear all the items in a certain location | add them back to different places easily |
