## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`FlashcardListPanel`, `ScoreHistoryListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `WeeblingoParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("learn")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `learn` Command](images/LearnSequenceDiagram.png)

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.

* stores the Weeblingo data.

* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FlashcardBook`, which `Flashcard` references. This allows `FlashcardBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Flashcard` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the flashcard book data (flashcards and scores) in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.weeblingo.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

### Tagging Flashcards

The tagging mechanism allows users to add tags to flashcards of their choice while in the _Learn Mode_
of the WeebLingo application. Each flashcard has a set of default tags which cannot be edited, followed by
any unique user added tags. 

![Structure of the Flashcard with tags](images/FlashcardWithTagsObjectDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user adds a new command:

![NewTagActivityDiagram](images/NewTagActivityDiagram.png)

The tags function ties together with the Start function of the application, as users can choose to start a quiz
containing flashcards that have the same tag only (to be implemented...)

### Quiz Command

The quiz command is used to enter Quiz mode, allowing the user to start various quizzes from there.
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters the Quiz command:

![QuizActivityDiagram](images/QuizActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the Quiz command works:

![QuizSequenceDiagram](images/QuizSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Quiz Scoring
*{To be updated}*

### View Past Quiz Attempts

The view quiz history mechanism allows users to view their past attempts of quizzes. Each entry of quiz history is
represented in a way similar how the flashcards are represented in the Weeblingo application. 

Below is the class diagram
for how `Score` is represented in *Model* component.

![HistoryModelDiagram](images/HistoryModelDiagram.png)

The *UI* component, which originally only handles the display of flashcards,
now needs to handle the display for scoring history as well.

The following sequence diagram shows how the UI switches display from flashcards to score history and vice versa.

![HistoryUiSequenceDiagram](images/HistoryUiSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to represent `Score` in the application

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make `Score` and `Flashcard` two separate classes.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: 
      * May have the overhead of writing similar code. For instance, `JsonAdaptedFlashcard` and `JsonAdaptedScore`.
      * Changing the UI display from flashcards to score history may be cumbersome. 
* **Alternative 2:** Let `Score` have inheritance relationship with `Flashcard`.
    * Pros: Changing UI display is easy.
    * Cons:
      * The design choice is not intuitive (`Score` does not seem to be a `Flashcard` and vice versa).
      * The overhead of maintaining the inheritance is non-trivial.
