### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of
each component.

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the
[PlantUML Tutorial at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create
and edit diagrams.

**Note:** The lifeline for classes in sequence diagrams shown in this Developer's Guide should end at the destroy marker
(X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

An example of how the components interact with each other upon user input is given in the sequence diagram below.
The user input in this example is `delete 1`:

![Sequence Diagram of the Architecture](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details about each individual component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc.

The `NotifWindow` and `NotesWindow` classes inherit from the `Alert` class.
All other classes, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
   help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences, including GUI sizings and more.
* stores client data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save client data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
These include configuration settings and common utilities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how features added in this iteration are implemented.

### Representing gender of clients

The gender of each client is represented as a `String` with the full gender (Male/ Female/ Non-binary). However, the
parse will accept any of `M`, `F`, `N`, `Male`, `Female`, `Non-binary` in any combination of upper and lower cases, and then
convert it to the full gender. For example, `NoN-binARy` will be successfully recognized as non-binary.

### Representing birthdate of clients

The birthdate of each client is currently represented as a `LocalDate` object instead of a `String`. This allows us to
use `LocalDate.parse()` to check for the validity of dates, as well as restricting the range of input dates from
`1900-01-01` to `LocalDate.now()`. Link.me supports only strict parsing, which means all invalid dates will not be
recognized and common mistakes like inputting non-existent dates such as the 31st of September will not be automatically
round down to the 30th of September.


### Representing insurance premiums of insurance plans

The premium of a client's insurance plan is represented and stored as a `String` to support large amounts without the
risk of overflow. This is to support all currency values, including those that have a much lower value than SGD.
The validity of the user's input amount is checked using regular expressions. Unnecessary leading zeroes in the input
string are trimmed, and the input string is padded with zeroes as necessary to format it to 2 decimal places.

### Adding or removing insurance plans of clients
![PlanSequenceDiagram](images/PlanSequenceDiagram.png)

The `PlanCommand` is created and parsed similar to other commands, as shown in the sequence diagram above. Depending
on the `Prefix` the user inputs (`i/` or `c/`), an `AddPlanCommand` or a `RemovePlanCommand` will be created and
returned respectively.

### Recording, viewing and clearing notes for clients
![NoteSequenceDiagram](images/NoteSequenceDiagram.png)

The `NoteCommand` is created and parsed similar to other commands, as shown in the sequence diagram above. The `Prefix`
that the user called the command with (`r/` to record note, `v/` to view notes, `c/` to clear notes) is stored as an
additional parameter in the `NoteCommand`.


![NoteSequenceDiagramRef](images/NoteSequenceDiagramRef.png)

Upon executing a `NoteCommand`, a different sequence of actions is performed by the `NoteCommand`, depending on the
`Prefix` stored in the `NoteCommand`.

Viewing notes will simply create and return a `CommandResult`. This `CommandResult` contains the `Person` object
representing the appropriate `Person`. This `Person` is passed back to the `Ui`, which will display the notes of this
`Person` in the `NotesWindow`.

Recording and clearing notes will call the respective methods of the appropriate
`Person` that the user has indicated. The `Person` will return an updated `Person` object, and `NoteCommand`
will proceed to call the `ModelManager` to replace the original `Person` with the updated `Person`. A `CommandResult`
is then created and returned.


### Listing, Finding and filtering clients

Upon executing a `ListCommand`, `FindCommand` or `FilterCommand`, a sequence of action is performed by the
corresponding commands. All 3 commands work similarly: while `ListCommand` does not require any additional user
inputs, additional users inputs for `FindCommand` and `FilterCommand` are required and will be parsed to create
Predicate objects. As for the `ListCommand`, the Predicate object will simply return true. These predicates will then
be used to determine which `Person` in the `UniquePersonList` found in the `AddressBook` will be added to the
`FilteredList`, which will then be iteratively displayed to the user.

### Scheduling meetings and Meeting List Display

The implementation of scheduling a meeting is as showcased below:

![ScheduleSequenceDiagramLogic](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagramLogic.png)
![ScheduleSequenceDiagramModel](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagramModel.png)

The current implementation of the `Meeting` class places `Meeting` as an attribute of `Person`. While it
certainly makes more sense to adopt an implementation where `Person` is an attribute of `Meeting` in order to better
support extensions and many-to-many relations, we would have to examine and update every `Meeting` object to edit the
`Person` if we were to update and change a `Person` as the current implementation of `Person` does not contain an
immutable and unique identifier.

As a result, the current implementation of `UniqueMeetingList` takes in `Person` as the element of the list, and
accesses the meeting attribute within the `Person` object when needed. `UniqueMeetingList` contains both a `TreeMap`
with `Meeting` as the key and the owner `Person` as the value, as well as an internal `List`. Regarding the editing of
the `UniqueMeetingList`, every time the `UniquePersonList` is edited, `UniqueMeetingList` is edited as well. Hence,
alteration only remains on the `Model` and `Ui` components.

In future installments, this implementation may be scraped in favor for an implementation where the `Meeting` class acts
as the wrapper for the `Person` class, or an implementation where `Person` and `Meeting` are separate entities,
but for the sake of functionality and simplicity, we shall keep the current implementation as is.

### Unscheduling meetings

The implementation of unscheduling meetings is very similar to scheduling meetings, so we skip the details of the
implementations here and would like to ask the reader to refer to the implementation of scheduling meetings as reference.

The behavior of the unscheduling command and its options are shown as below.
![UnscheduleActivityDiagram](images/UnscheduleActivityDiagram.png)

The internal operation of removing a `Meeting` involves locating the owner `Person` on the internal `List` stored in
`UniqueMeetingList`, then use the `Meeting` (the key) to remove the owner `Person` (the value) from the internal
`TreeMap`, then exporting the values in the `TreeMap` back into the internal `List`.

### Displaying Notifications

![NotifSequenceDiagram](images/NotifSequenceDiagram.png)

The implementation of showing notifications is separated into two parts. The first part handles the input `Command` and
returns a `CommandResult` indicating whether the `Command` is a `NotifCommand` and returns it to the `MainWindow`. For the
second part of the implementation, the `MainWindow` handles the `CommandResult` and requests the notifications from
`Logic`, which in turn requests from `Model`. The `MainWindow` then sends the notification string to the `NotifWindow` to
be displayed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Effort**

### Meetings and scheduling
While AB3 only deals with a single entity, `Link.me` deals with an additional entity - `Meeting`. As `Meeting` and
`Person` are closely intertwined, the level of dependency between the two entities had to be carefully determined.
Another issue we had to face with `Meeting` was that the `Meeting` entity was time-related, thus some operations could
not be easily tested. Due to the time-related nature of `Meeting`, we also had to come up with a method to order
`Meeting` according to time when put on display.

### Notifications and notes
Notifications and notes had too much information to fit on the main GUI window, thus we had to display the information
on a separate window. As the construction of a new stage was troublesome especially when we still wanted keyboard
operations like `Enter` to still work on the new window as well as keep the main GUI consistent, we decided to piggyback
the implementation on the inbuilt `JavaFX Alert` class, which proved to be another hassle, as `Alert` windows were not
designed to hold that much information. As a result, we had to sacrifice a bit of UI theme consistency over successful
functionality.

### Insurance plans
For insurance plans, the troubling part was to try to keep the similar functionalities of adding and removing within the
same command in order to reduce user confusion. A separate parser had to be implemented. Another challenge was that the
insurance premiums could be very large when we wanted to subject it to different small value currencies. Hence, we had
to store the value as a `String` with validations made with regular expressions, something else we had to learn, instead
of an `Integer`.

### Filtering clients
For filtering clients, the main issue was trying to express the selection criteria of different attributes as
predicates, to which we had to utilize functional programming techniques instead of more common OOP usage. The parser
for the filter command was also more complex than other commands to construct. In particular, for filtering, we also
had to filter by age, which required an extra processing step as compared to filtering by other attributes.

### UI
The UI tinkering for the MainWindow proved to be a major hurdle as we wanted the UI to remain viewable even after
extreme inputs, which we allowed in order to give our users the greatest flexibility. The GUI also had to stay intact
when the window is restarted. Furthermore, GUI behaviors could be different on different OSes, so we had to test the GUI
under different environments.
