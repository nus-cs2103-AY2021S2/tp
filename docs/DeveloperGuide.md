## **Introduction**
### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to cover the multi-level design architecture of Dictionote, so that the
intended audience of this document can understand the relationship between components that make up Dictionote.

### Audience

This developer guide is for anyone who wants to understand the internal software architecture of Dictionote.
The following groups of people are the intended audience:
* Dictionote developers: anyone who wish to upgrade Dictionote to support more functions.
* CS2103/T students: students of CS2103/T who want to improve their efficiency and productivity in learning.

### Dictionote Overview

Dictionote is a desktop app for CS2103/T Students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Dictionote in general helps to organise content and
definitions from the CS2103/T textbook, provide Note-keeping functions to facilitate learning, and enhance the ability
for students to connect and learn together with their cohort mates.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DictionaryListPanel`, `DictionaryContentPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.dictionote.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Contact features

#### Sending an email to a contact

##### Implementation

This feature is implemented as a command, `EmailCommand`, that extends `Command`. It is an index-dependent command, meaning that the user must provide an index number when typing the command as a reference to a specific contact on the contacts list.

The index number was selected to refer to a particular contact. This is due to its character length being shorter in most cases than any other field of information in `Contact` objects, making it both simple and sufficient.

The `execute()` method attempts to open a new window of the user's operating system (OS) default mail client. This is done by navigating to a `mailto` link with the contact's email address added to the end.

As an example, consider running Dictionote on a Windows 10 machine with Microsoft Outlook as the OS default mail client:

* Assume that the current state of the application is as follows (note the exisiting contacts on the left-side of the application's window):

![ContactEmailFeatureInitState](images/ContactEmailFeatureInitState.png)

* After typing in `emailcontact 2` and executing it, the result would be:

![ContactEmailFeatureExecute](images/ContactEmailFeatureExecute.png)

* A new window, belonging to Microsoft Outlook's `New Message` function, will pop up:

![ContactEmailFeatureOSClient](images/ContactEmailFeatureOSClient.png)

* Note that the email of the selected contact, Bob (referred to in the command by his index number), is automatically written in the `To...` field of the email's header information.

Note that if the user does not have a mail client software set as default in their OS, then Dictionote will try to navigate to the `mailto` link through the user's default browser (i.e., the `mailto` link will be treated as an ordinary URL link).

##### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** make use of the OS mail client to facilitate email features.
	* Pros: Easy to implement; utilizes a pre-existing and standardized system for invoking mail xyz.
	* Cons: Requires the user to have a mail client installed on their OS, which is then set to be the default mail client of the system.

* **Alternative 2:** implement basic email features directly into Dictionote.
	* Pros: Does not depened on the existence of external software in the OS.
	* Cons: Much harder to implement, as it requires the implementation of network-related functions to handle the connections to email servers.
	
	
#### More implementation details to be added...

### UI features

#### Manipulation UI through Command
#####  Implementation
Dictionote provides a dynamic user interface that allows the user to open and close any panel. 
When executing any given command, dictionote will have to be able to change the user interface. 
While all commands can open or close the UI panel. The user is also given the ability to manipulate UI through user command. 
The feature is implemented through the `CommandResult` that all `Command` in the system return.

`CommandResult` store a string `feedbackToUser`, enum `UiAction` and enum `UiActionOption`. `feedbackToUser` will 
be show on the `ResultDisplay` as the command execution feedback. 
`UiAction` indicate the action the command the want the `UI` to take. 
e.g `UiAction.OPEN`, `UiAction.CLOSE`, `UiAction.EXIT`, ... etc. `UiActionOption` is only applicable to some `UiAction`. 
It indicate the specific option available for the `UiAction`. 
e.g `UiActionOption.Dictionary` for `UiActionOpen` mean open dictionary panel.

The following is the sequence diagram for  `OPENCOMMAND`

![OpenCommandSequenceDiagram](images/OpenCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of the existing command `CommandResult` class
    * Pros: make use of the existing system and easy to implement
    * Cons: All command will have to decide on the response. (or use the default setting)
* Alternative 2: Make use of the Model Component as an intermediary between Command and UI. The command will call a method available on the model to make a change to the UI.
    * Pros: Only the class that requires to change in UI will be needed to call the method
    * Cons: Increasing coupling.




<!--
### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
