## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other in the scenario where the user issues the command `delete A1234567X`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `StudentBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `"delete A1234567X"` Command API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete A1234567X` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the student book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

> **NOTE:** `StudentBook` contains all student records and appointment data. 
> 
>
### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the student book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.student.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student `Add`

#### Actual Implementation

The `Add` Student mechanism is implemented in the `AddCommand` class and facilitated by the following classes:
* `Command`. `AddCommand` extends `Command` and overrides the `execute` method, which adds a `Student` to the `Model`. 
* `AddCommandParser`. It implements the `Parser` interface, which is used by all commands to read user input. `AddCommandParser` also checks the parameters of `AddCommand` and make sures that the input adheres to the specified format. 

All 8 compulsory fields and 1 optional field in `Student` are updated and added to the system following the user input. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Add` Student mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user executes `add A1234567X n/John Doe f/COM p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/vaccinated m/peanut allergy r/RVRC` to add a student. The `StudentBookParser` class determines that the command called is `Add`, and therefore creates a new `AddCommandParser` instance to parse the command.

Step 2: The `AddCommandParser` instance obtains the user input and checks for its validity. It then returns a new `AddCommand` instance to the `LogicManager` via the `StudentBookParser` class.

> **NOTE:** If the input format is incorrect or not found, `AddCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` to tell the user about the error, and execution will stop. 


Step 3: With the `AddCommand` instance, the overridden `execute` method is called to add the `Student` to the `Model`. The `LogicManager` then receives the result of the execution of the command. 


Step 4: The added `Student` is saved into the `StudentBook`. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Add` operation works:

![Add Sequence Diagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `Add` command:

![Add Activity Diagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How `Add` Student executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add all the attributes of a student at once
    * Pros: 
      * All the student attributes will be completed in one command, less likely to introduce bugs. 
    * Cons: 
      * Command can be difficult to use, confusing to check. 
      * User needs to know all the attributes of a student before adding to system.  

* **Alternative 2:** Add each student attribute individually
  * Pros: 
    * Easier for user to input, potentially fewer mistakes as user can check each attribute individually.
    * User does not need to know all the information of a student before adding to system. 
  * Cons: 
    * User could forget to add certain attributes, potentially causing bugs later. 
    
In the end, Alternative 1 was chosen because it is less likely to introduce bugs into the system, even though it comes with some usability cost. However, the cost of having multiple bugs could be greater. Moreover, the user can use the edit command afterwards to fix any incorrect information added. This would help to mitigate some downsides of this implementation.

### Delete Student `delete`

#### Actual Implementation
The delete student feature helps users to delete a particular student's record by the student's matriculation number.

The delete student feature is implemented in the `DeleteCommand` class and facilitated by the following classes:
* `Command`. `DeleteCommand` extends `Command` and overrides the `execute` method, which deletes a `Student` from the `Model`.
* `DeleteCommandParser`. It implements the `Parser` interface, which is used by all commands to read user input. `DeleteCommandParser` also checks the parameters of `DeleteCommand` and make sures that the input adheres to the specified format.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete student mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user executes `delete A1234567X` to delete a student. The `StudentBookParser` class determines that the command called is `delete`, and therefore creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` instance to parse the command.

Step 2: The `DeleteCommandParser` instance obtains the user input and checks for its validity. It then returns a new `DeleteCommand` instance to the `LogicManager` via the `StudentBookParser` class.

> **NOTE:** If the input format is incorrect or not found, `DeleteCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` to notify the user of the error, and the execution will stop.
> 

Step 3: With the `DeleteCommand` instance, the overridden `execute` method is called to delete the `Student` from the `Model`. The `LogicManager` then receives the result of the execution of the command.

Step 4: The specified `Student` is deleted from the `StudentBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete student operation works:

![Delete Student Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `delete` command:

![Delete Student Activity Diagram](images/DeleteStudentActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How Delete Student executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete student based on student's matriculation number.
    * Pros:
        * User can ensure that the correct student will be deleted as matriculation number is unique to a student.
    * Cons:
        * User is required to know the student's matriculation number to perform the action.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete student using student's name
    * Pros:
        * User is not required to know the student's matriculation number.
    * Cons:
        * User might have to go through extra steps to identify and delete a student if there is another student with the same name in the system.
        * User has to type more words if the student name is too long.

In the end, Alternative 1 was chosen because it is less likely to introduce bugs into the system, even though it comes with some usability cost.
Furthermore, in Alternative 2, the user could potentially identify and delete the wrong student if there are multiple students sharing the same name.

### Add Appointment `AddAppt`

#### Actual Implementation
An appointment is uniquely determined by a student's matriculation number. Other attributes relevant to an appointment include date, start time, and end time, all of which are compulsory.

The add appointment feature is facilitated by `AddAppointmentCommandParser` and `AddAppointmentCommand`. Implementing `Parser` interface, `AddAppointmentCommandParser` takes in user's command and creates a new appointment based on the parsed data. `AddAppointmentCommand`, inheriting from `Command`, adds the newly created `Appointment` to the `Model`.

Given below is an example usage scenario that elucidates the mechanism of the add appointment feature.

Step 1: The user executes `addAppt A1234567X d/2021-12-13 ts/13:00 te/14:00` to add an appointment. `StudentBookParser` determines that the command called is to add an appointment, hence creating a new `AddAppointmentCommandParser` instance.

Step 2: The `AddAppointmentCommandParser` instance parses the user input and performs validation on the parsed data. It then creates a new `AddAppointmentCommand` instance.

> **NOTE:** If the input format is incorrect or not found, `AddAppointmentCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` to notify the user of the error.

Step 3: `AddAppointmentCommand` executes to add the appointment to `Model`. The `LogicManager` then receives the result of the execution of the command.

Step 4: The added `Appointment` is saved into the `StudentBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add appointment operation works:

![Add Appointment Sequence Diagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddAppt` command:

![Add Appointment Activity Diagram](images/AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How Add Appointment executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new appointment using student's matriculation number.
    * Pros:
        * Each appointment is ensured to be unique to every student.
    * Cons:
        * Using matriculation number instead of student's name might not be intuitive.
        * User needs to know student's matriculation number before adding a new appointment.

* **Alternative 2:** Add a new appointment using student's name
    * Pros:
        * More intuitive for user.
        * User does not need to know student's matriculation to perform the action.
    * Cons:
        * Problems might arise when different students have the same name, leading to a potentially complicated error handling mechanism.

In the end, Alternative 1 was chosen because it is less likely to introduce bugs into the system, even though it comes with some usability cost. Alternative 1 also minimizes potentially taxing actions required to resolve scenarios where different students have the same name.

### Find Student `find`

#### Actual Implementation

The find student feature helps users to locate a particular student's record by the student's matriculation number along with the corresponding appointment if present.

This feature is facilitated by `FindCommandParser` which implements the `Parser` interface and `FindCommand` which extends the abstract class `Command`. 
`FindCommandParser` takes in the user's command and validates the input before passing it to `FindCommand`.
FindCommand will invoke a method to search for the particular student's record and their corresponding appointment in Model and return the specific student's record with their appointment if it exists.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find student mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user executes `find A0175678U` into Vax@NUS.

Step 2: The input will be parsed to the `LogicManager execute` method which invokes `FindCommandParser` to perform validation on the input.
> **NOTE:** If the matriculation number given by the user is in the wrong format, `FindCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` to stop the execution and inform user about the error.

Step 3: The instance of `FindCommandParser` will create a new `FindCommand` instance which will retrieve and return the student's record and the appointment belonging to the particular student from `Model`.

Step 4: Display the particular student's record and appointment onto the UI. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![Find_Student_ Sequence Diagram](images/FindStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `Find` command:

![Find Student_Activity Diagram](images/FindStudentActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How Find Student executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find student based on student's matriculation number.
    * Pros:
        * Each student's record found uniquely identifies a student. 
        * Only one student's record and one appointment is shown if the particular student exists and has an appointment in the system. 
    * Cons:
        * The user is required to know the student's matriculation number to perform the action. 
        

* **Alternative 2:** Find student using student's name
    * Pros:
        * User is not required to know the student's matriculation number.
    * Cons:
        * Multiple student records and appointments will be shown for students with the same name. Users will have to manually look through all entries to find the desired student and appointment records.
        * The user has to type more words if the student name is too long. 

In the end, Alternative 1 was chosen because it is less likely to introduce bugs into the system, even though it comes with some usability cost.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope
**Target user profile story**: <br> <br>
Ian is a former air crew with Singapore Airlines. He recently lost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the collapse in international travel.
He found a job with the University Health Center (UHC) as an admin executive. He is a fast typist with good knowledge of the command line interface.
Currently, Ian is using Excel to keep track of all the student records and vaccination appointments in UHC. With so many rows and columns of data to look at, 
Ian finds it difficult to sieve information and is prone to making human errors.

**Target user profile**:

* UHC staff who has a need to manage a significant number of appointments and student records
* UHC staff who has to keep track of NUS (National University of Singapore) students' COVID-19 vaccinations regarding:
  * Who has been vaccinated
  * Who has not been vaccinated
  * Who wants to be vaccinated
    * Medical histories, existing medical conditions and allergies
* Prefers desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* Tired of looking at multiple rows and columns in Excel for long hours daily

**Value proposition**: a one stop management app to efficiently track and schedule COVID-19 vaccinations for NUS students
