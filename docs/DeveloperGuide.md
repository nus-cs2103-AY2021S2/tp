## **Introduction**

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a brief overview of the multi-level design architecture of SmartLib,
so that you would be able to gain a better understanding of the relationship between
the various components that SmartLib is made up from.

### Audience

This Developer Guide (DG) is meant for any user who is interested in understanding the internal design architecture of
SmartLib. Some of our intended audience include:

* SmartLib's developers: any developer who may want to upgrade or extend SmartLib's features to support a greater range
of features and functions.

* Tech-savvy users of SmartLib: users of SmartLib who may want to improve the efficiency and features of our
application to support their needs are also welcome to explore our application with the help of this DG.

### Overview

SmartLib is a desktop app for managing libraries and private book loaning services owning less than 10,000 books,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, SmartLib would be a brilliant and efficient assistant in the systematic management of your books
and borrowers' information, as compared to the traditional GUI apps currently available in the market.

## **Design**

### Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of
each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the
[diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder.
Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn
how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/Main.java) and
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API
`interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `deletereader 1`.
![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ReaderListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `SmartLibParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a reader).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletereader 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletereader 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for
`DeleteReaderCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline
reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the SmartLib data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Reader>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model
is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `SmartLib`, which `Reader` references. This allows `SmartLib` to only require
one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Reader` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/smartlib/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SmartLib data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.smartlib.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Book

#### Adding a book
The execution of adding a book `addbook` is very similar to adding a reader `addreader` (refer to diagrams under [**`Adding a reader`**](#adding-a-reader)).

#### Deleting a book

The execution of deleting a book and deleting a reader is very similar (refer to the sequence diagram under
[**`Logic`**](#logic-component)).

The only difference is that `DeleteBookCommandParser` is used to parse the
argument(s) and `DeleteBookCommand` is created. In order to delete a book,
`Model#deleteBook()` is called instead of `Model#deleteReader()`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happen when a user executes a delete book command.

![DeleteBookActivityDiagram](images/DeleteBookActivityDiagram.png)

#### Finding books with keywords

Finding books in the book list requires a user input from the CLI.
The respective parsers will parse the user input to check whether the input is valid, and obtain the keyword(s) of the
book(s) that the user wants to find.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the `findbook` mechanism behaves at each step. In our example and the
diagrams below, we assume that the user input is `findbook Harry Potter`:
* Step 1: The user launches the SmartLib application with all of his/her readers already added to the reader list.
* Step 2: The user inputs `findbook Harry Potter` to SmartLib, which calls upon `LogicManager#execute()`.
* Step 3: `SmartLibParser` and `FindBookCommandParser` will check the user input, and return a `FindBookCommand` to the
`LogicManager` if the input is valid.
* Step 4: `LogicManager` will then call `FindBookCommand#execute()`, which in turn calls
`Model#updateFilteredBookList()`.
* Step 5: The book list is updated and reflected on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `findbook` operation works:

![FindBookSequenceDiagram](images/FindBookSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `findbook` command:

![FindBookActivityDiagram](images/FindBookActivityDiagram.png)

#### Listing all books

The execution of listing all books is very similar to listing all readers. The difference is that a `ListBookCommand` 
is created instead of `ListReaderCommand`. Also, `Model#updateFilteredReaderList()` is called instead of `Model#updateFilteredReaderList()`.

#### Listing overdue books

The execution of listing overdue books is very similar to listing books. The only difference between them is the predicate passed into the method `Model#updateFilteredBookList()`.
When listing all books, the predicate will always return true for all books (e.g. `book -> true`), but for listing overdue books, 
the predicate is `book -> book.isOverdue()`, which will call `Book#isOverdue()`.

### Reader

#### Adding a reader
Adding a reader into a class requires user input from the CLI.
The `SmartLibParser` will parse the user input to check the validity of it, the input is valid if
1. The reader does not already exist in the code base.
2. The formats for the name, phone, email and address are correct.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the `addreader` mechanism behaves at each step.
* Step 1: The user launches the SmartLib application with all of his/her readers already added to the reader list.
* Step 2: The user inputs `addreader r/Tom p/81688168 e/tom@email.com a/Queestown` to SmartLib, which calls upon
`LogicManager#execute()`.
* Step 3: `SmartLibParser` and `AddReaderCommandParser` checks the user input and returns an `AddReaderCommand` to the
`LogicManager` if the input is valid.
* Step 4: `LogicManager` calls `AddReaderCommand#execute()`, which in turn calls `Model#addReader()`.
* Step 5: By calling `Model#addReader()`, `ModelManager` then calls `SmartLib#addReader()` and
`Model#updateUniqueReaderList()`.
* Step 6: `SmartLib#addReader()` adds the reader to the reader list.
* Step 7: `ModelManager#updateUniqueReaderList()` updates the reader list in local storage file.
* Step 8: The reader list is updated in the storage and reflected on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addreader` operation works:

![AddReaderSequenceDiagram](images/AddReaderSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addreader` command:

![AddReaderActivityDiagram](images/AddReaderActivityDiagram.png)


#### Deleting a reader
The execution of deleting a reader `deletereader` is very similar to deleting a book `deletebook` (refer to diagrams under [**`Deleting a book`**](#deleting-a-book)).


#### Listing all readers

Listing all readers in a class requires user input from the CLI.
The `SmartLibParser` will then create a `ListReaderCommand`, which will trigger Model to update the GUI with a full list
of the readers.

**Notes:**
* Any arguments that the user inputs after the command `listreader` will not be examined by the application.
* If the current view of the GUI is already the full list of readers, `listreader` will not refresh or update the GUI.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the `listreader` mechanism behaves at each step:
* Step 1: The user launches the SmartLib application with all of his/her readers already added to the reader list.
* Step 2: The user inputs `listreader` to SmartLib, which calls upon `LogicManager#execute()`.
* Step 3: `SmartLibParser` checks the user input and returns a `ListReaderCommand` to the `LogicManager` if the input is
valid.
* Step 4: `LogicManager` will then call `ListReaderCommand#execute()`, which in turn calls
`Model#updateFilteredReaderList()`.
* Step 5: The reader list is updated and reflected on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listreader` operation works:

![ListReaderSequenceDiagram](images/ListReaderSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `listreader` command:

![ListReaderActivityDiagram](images/ListReaderActivityDiagram.png)

#### Finding readers with keywords

The execution of finding a reader using keywords and finding a book using keywords is very similar (you may want to
refer to the diagrams under [**`Finding books with keywords`**](#finding-books-with-keywords)).

The only differences are that `FindReaderCommandParser` is used to parse the argument(s) and instead of
`FindBookCommandParser`, and an object of `FindReaderCommand` is created. In order to find a reader using keywords,
`Model#updateFilteredReaderList()` is called instead of `Model#updateFilteredBookList()`.

### Record

#### Borrowing a book

Recording a reader borrowing a book requires a user input from the CLI.
The respective parsers will parse the user input to check whether the input is valid, the input is valid if
1. The book and reader specified exist in the code base.
2. The book is available.
3. The reader does not have overdue books or exceed his borrowing quota.

Then take the following pseudo processes:
1. Obtain the Reader object and the Book object based on the identity provided by the user.
2. Add a corresponding record to the record List.
3. Update reader and book's borrowing status by adding the book in reader's borrowing list and setting the book's
borrower to the reader.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the `borrow` mechanism behaves at each step. In our example and the
diagrams below,
we assume that the user input is `borrow r/Tom bc/1000000001`:
* Step 1: The user launches the SmartLib application with all of his/her readers already added to the reader list and
books added to the book list.
* Step 2: The user inputs `borrow r/Tom bc/1000000001` to SmartLib, which calls upon `LogicManager#execute()`.
* Step 3: `SmartLibParser` and `BorrowCommandParser` will check the user input, and return a `BorrowCommand` to
  the `LogicManager` if the input is valid.
* Step 4: `LogicManager` will then call `BorrowCommand#execute()`, which in turn calls `Model#addRecord()` and
`Model#borrowBook()`.
* Step 5: For calling `Model#addRecord()`, `ModelManager` will then call `SmartLib#addRecord()` and
`Model#updateFilteredRecordList()`.
* Step 6: `SmartLib#addRecord()` will add the corresponding record to record list.
* Step 7: `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecordList()` will update corresponding record list in local storage file.
* Step 8: On the other hand, `ModelManager#borrowBook()` will change the borrowing status of book and reader's borrowing
list by calling `SmartLib#isBookBorrowed()` and
  update local storage by calling `Model#updateFilteredReaderList()` and `Model#updateFilteredBookList()`.
* Step 9: All reader list, book list and record list will be updated in storage and reflected on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `borrow` operation works:

![BorrowSequenceDiagram](images/BorrowSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `borrow` command:

![BorrowActivityDiagram](images/BorrowActivityDiagram.png)

#### Returning a book

Recording a reader returning a book requires a user input from the CLI.
The respective parsers will parse the user input to check whether the input is valid, the input is valid if
1. The book specified exists in the code base.
2. The book is borrowed by someone.
3. There is such a valid borrowing record existing in the code base.

Then take the following pseudo processes:
1. Obtain the Book object based on the identity provided by the user.
2. Mark the corresponding record as returned by indicating the dateReturned field.
3. Remove the book from reader's borrowing list and set book's borrower to null.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the `return` mechanism behaves at each step. In our example and the
diagrams below,
we assume that the user input is `return bc/1000000000`:
* Step 1: The user launches the SmartLib application with all of his/her readers, books and records already added to the 
  reader list, book list and record list respectively.
* Step 2: The user inputs `return bc/1000000000` to SmartLib, which calls upon `LogicManager#execute()`.
* Step 3: `SmartLibParser` and `ReturnCommandParser` will check the user input, and return a `ReturnCommand` to
  the `LogicManager` if the input is valid.
* Step 4: `LogicManager` will then call `ReturnCommand#execute()`, which in turn calls `Model#getReaderNameForReturn()`, 
  `Model#getBookNameForReturn()`, `Model#markRecordAsReturned()` and `Model#returnBook()`.
* Step 5: After calling `Model#markRecordAsReturned()`, `ModelManager` will then call `SmartLib#markRecordAsReturned()`.
* Step 6: `SmartLib#markRecordAsReturned()` will find the corresponding record in the record list and set the
  dateReturned to `LocalDate.now()`.
* Step 7: After calling `Model#returnBook()`, `ModelManager` will then call `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecordList()`
  which will update the corresponding record list in local storage file.
* Step 8: `ModelManager#returnBook()` will also change the status of book and reader specified by calling
  `SmartLib#isBookReturned()` and update local storage by calling `Model#updateFilteredReaderList()` and `Model#updateFilteredBookList()`.
* Step 9: All reader list, book list and record list will be updated in storage and reflected on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `return` operation works:

![ReturnSequenceDiagram](images/ReturnSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `return` command:

![ReturnActivityDiagram](images/ReturnActivityDiagram.png)

#### Returning overdue books

This section is a more detailed explanation of how the system deals with returned book that is overdue.
This process happens after `ReturnCommand#returnBook()` and before creating a `CommandResult` object (refer to
[**`this`**](#returning-a-book)).

Given below is an example scenario of how the system deals with overdue book at each step.
Here, we assume that the book is indeed overdue by 10 hours.

* Step 1: `ReturnCommand` checks whether the book is overdue by invoking its own method `ReturnCommand#isOverdue()`.
* Step 2: `ReturnCommand` instantiate a `Cost` object with parameter `10`.
* Step 3: `Cost#getCost()` will returns the total amount of fine that the reader is required to pay.

The following sequence diagram shows how `ReturnCommand` deals with overdue book.

![OverdueBookSequenceDiagram](images/OverdueBookSequenceDiagram.png)

#### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

##### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSmartLib`. It extends `SmartLib` with an undo/redo history,
stored internally as an `smartLibStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following
operations:

* `VersionedSmartLib#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current SmartLib state in its history.
* `VersionedSmartLib#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous SmartLib state from its history.
* `VersionedSmartLib#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone SmartLib state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSmartLib()`, `Model#undoSmartLib()` and
`Model#redoSmartLib()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSmartLib` will be initialized with the
initial SmartLib state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single SmartLib state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deletereader 5` command to delete the 5th reader in the SmartLib. The `deletereader` command calls
`Model#commitSmartLib()`, causing the modified state of the SmartLib after the `deletereader 5` command executes to be saved
in the `smartLibStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted SmartLib state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addreader r/Tom p/81688168 e/tom@email.com a/Queenstown` to add a new reader. The `addreader` command also calls `Model#commitSmartLib()`,
causing another modified SmartLib state to be saved into the `smartLibStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will
not call `Model#commitSmartLib()`, so the SmartLib state will not be saved into the `smartLibStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the reader was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSmartLib()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to
the left, pointing it to the previous SmartLib state, and restores the SmartLib to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0,
pointing to the initial SmartLib state, then there are no previous SmartLib states to restore. The `undo` command uses
`Model#canUndoSmartLib()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than
attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoSmartLib()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to
the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the SmartLib to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index
`smartLibStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest SmartLib state, then there are no undone SmartLib states to
restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSmartLib()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error
to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listreader`. Commands that do not modify the SmartLib, such as `listreader`,
will usually not call `Model#commitSmartLib()`, `Model#undoSmartLib()` or `Model#redoSmartLib()`. Thus, the
`smartLibStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear-everything-in-my-smartlib`, which calls `Model#commitSmartLib()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing
at the end of the `smartLibStateList`, all SmartLib states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no
longer makes sense to redo the `addreader r/Tom p/81688168 e/tom@email.com a/Queenstown` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications
follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration and Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire SmartLib.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletereader`, just save the reader being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* an owner of a private book loan service
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* types fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is proficient with using CLI apps
* is very meticulous
* wants to keep track of his/her loans
* wants to keep track of the details of all of his/her books
* wants to keep track of the condition of the book before and after the loan

**Value proposition**: systematic management of books and borrowers' information.
* It would be a pain for private book loan services to have to keep track of their books by paper.
* By having a reliable system to keep track of things, it would help save the owners of private book loan services an
immense amount of time.
