## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PassengerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a passenger).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1 2")` API call. This is also explained [below](#deleting-a-passenger).

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1 2` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the GME terminal data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Passenger>` and `ObservableList<Pool>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Passenger` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Passenger` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Model

The class diagram for the `Model` can be seen [above](#model-component) in the Design section. Such a design was chosen after a few iterations on other designs. One such design is briefly documented as below:

**v1.2**

![v1.2 Model](images/Modelv1_2.png)

In v1.2, `Passenger` has-an optional `Driver`, which was initially chosen for its ease of implementation and storage. However, it was spotted that this would lead to issues in future when implementing trips on multiple days, since each `Driver` would have their own times, leading to a lot of duplication of `Drivers`. Further, this was not an easy format to display to the user intuitively, and would require a traverse of the whole `Passenger` list just to group `Passengers` by `Drivers`.

#### Implementation
Therefore, the decision was made to encapsulate the details of each trip (which is a trip by 1 driver with multiple passengers), into a `Pool` class. This `Pool` class would have it's own CRUD, and would contain a `Driver`, `Passengers`, `TripDay` and `TripTime`.

This is done to facilitate `Storage` and `UI`, and also from a Users perspective, to allow for `Pools` with timings that may be slightly different from the `Passengers` preferred time.

A package `Pool` containing class `Pool` and `UniquePoolList` was created. This package performs a function that is similar to the `Passenger` package, exposing CRUD operations through `ModelManager`.

The decision was also made to make `Passenger` and `Driver` extend `Person`, so that for future iterations, we can support a `Driver` who is also a `Passenger` with minimal changes to the code.

### Storage

As above, with regards to [Model](#model-component), the initial implementation of `Storage` was simply to store a `Driver` as a `String` field inside Passenger.

However, this involved extra parsing to ensure that the `Driver` String was still a valid `Driver` on load. Therefore, `Driver` was also made into a Jackson `JsonProperty`.

The class diagram for `Storage` can be found [above](#storage-component).

#### Implementation

As of v1.3, the relation between `Driver` and `Passenger` is encapsulated in a `Pool`. All of `Driver`, `Passenger`, `Pool` and `Tag` are stored as JSON Objects. The choice was also made to store all data in 1 file, for ease of portability, such that the user only needs to manage 1 file.

At a high level, the JSON file is structured as such:

![High level Storage Class Diagram](images/HighLevelStorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Passengers` are duplicated between the `Passenger` list and each of the `Pools` that reference the `Passenger` simply so we can reuse the `JsonSerializablePassenger` structure. This association would be much better represented in a RDBMS, which would be an easy change for a potential future iteration.

`JsonSerializableAddressBook` implements checks to ensure the following from the read JSON file:
* There are no duplicate Passengers
* There are no duplicate Pools
* No more than one Pool can reference a single Passenger
* There are no Pools that reference a Passenger that does not exist

This is to ensure the sanitization of data that is read from JSON, if the user decides to edit the JSON file directly.

### Pool feature
This feature allows users to create and add a pool to the list of pools, through the use of a `pool` command.

Design considerations include the `pool` command being able to be used in conjunction with the `find` command. For instance, the user would
first use `find tag/female` and then followed by `pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/MONDAY t/1930 c/2 c/3`.
The `find tag/female` command first filters the list of displayed passengers, such that only passengers with the `female` tag would be displayed. Calling the `pool` command
would then assign `Alice` with number `91234567` to be the driver of the passengers specified by the indices for the currently displayed list.

The activity diagram below encapsulates the user workflow of adding passengers, finding passengers and then pooling the passengers:

![Activity Diagram for a User Using Pool](images/PoolActivityDiagram.png)

The rationale behind this implementation was because once the GME terminal is populated with a large number of passengers, it would be rather difficult for the user to find a specific passenger.
By allowing the user to first filter the passengers then subsequently pooling from the filtered list would greatly enhance the feature, thereby making the product much more cohesive as features work well together.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3")` command.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3` Command](images/PoolSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  The `command` argument that is passed into
`execute()`, represents the string `"pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3"`, and has been abstracted for readability.
<br>
The lifeline for `PoolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which subsequently instantiates `PoolCommandParser` class to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then have its `parse()` method invoked to parse the arguments of `"n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3"` to
   `PoolCommandParser` which creates and returns a `PoolCommand`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `PoolCommand`, which in turn calls its own method of `getPassengersFromIndexes()`
    that gets a list of passengers from `Model` by calling `getFilteredPassengerList()`.
1. A `Pool` object is then instantiated with the list of passengers returned by `getPassengersFromIndexes()`, and then added to the model by the `addPool()` method.
1. The model filtered pool list is then updated with `updateFilteredPoolList()` with a predicate to show all pools in the list `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_POOLS`.
1. Finally, a `CommandResult` would be instantiated to indicate the completion status of the command and returned back to `LogicManager`.

It is worth noting that in the case of adding a passenger, a `Passenger` object is created by `AddCommandParser` and used in the constructor of `AddCommand`.
However, in the case of adding a pool, a `PoolCommand` is constructed using the details specified and parsed from `PoolCommandParser`, instead of creating and passing a `Pool` object.
The rationale is due the fact that a list of passengers have to be obtained from the indexes specified, which requires interactions with the model.
The current implementation thus encapsulates all the interactions with model, within the methods of `PoolCommand`.

### ListPool feature
This feature allows users to list all the pools from the pool list without any filter.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("listPool")`.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `listPool` Command](images/ListPoolSequenceDiagram.png)

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"listPool"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which subsequently instantiates an `ListPoolCommand` object to be returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `ListPoolCommand`.
1. The model filtered pool list is then updated with `updateFilteredPoolList()` with a predicate to show all pools in the list `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_POOLS`.
1. Finally, a `CommandResult` would be instantiated to indicate the completion status of the command and returned back to `LogicManager`.

### Unpool feature
This feature allows users to remove a pool from the pool list through the specification of an index.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("unpool 1")`.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `unpool 1` Command](images/UnpoolSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UnpoolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"unpool 1"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which subsequently instantiates `UnpoolCommandParser` class to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then have its `parse()` method invoked, passing the argument `"1"` to `UnpoolCommandParser`.
1. Given that the index `"1"` is a valid index, an `UnpoolCommand` object would be instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `UnpoolCommand` which in turn invokes `deletePool()` method with an argument of `1`.
1. This would update the model by deleting the specified pool at the first index, then a `CommandResult` would be instantiated to indicate the completion status of the command and returned back to `LogicManager`.

### FindPool feature
This feature allows users to find a pool that contains a passenger with a provided keyword in their name.

Design considerations include the `findPool` command being able to be used in conjunction with the `pool` or `unpool`  command. Due to the limitations of the current iteration of GME, each passenger can only belong to one pool. As the number of passengers and pools increases, it may be hard to keep track of the passengers that exist in pools and those that do not, thus, the user might attempt to create a new pool with a passenger and be informed that the passenger already exists in a pool. The `findPool` feature thus allows the user to find the pool that the passenger already exists in to either confirm if they are in the correctly assigned pool, or `unpool` them if they are not. The `findPool` command works similarly to the `find` command, except that it currently only supports the use of the name prefix: "n/"

The activity diagram below encapsulates the user workflow of attempting to pool a passenger, finding out that the passenger already exists in a pool, and using the `findPool` command to rectify the issue:

![Activity Diagram for a user using findPool](images/findPoolActivityDiagram.png)

The rationale behind this implementation was because once the GME terminal is populated with a large number of pools, it would be rather difficult for the user to find a specific pool that includes a specific passenger. This could make it difficult to pool a passenger if they already exist in another pool. By allowing the user to filter the pools by the passengers they include, the user will be able to quickly find the pools that include the passenger they are attempting to pool, allowing them to confirm if they have been assigned to the right pool or to rectify the issue if they have not.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("findPool n/Alice")` command.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `findPool n/Alice` Command](images/FindPoolSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  The `command` argument that is passed into
`execute()`, represents the string `"findPool n/Alice"`, and has been abstracted for readability.
<br>
The lifeline for `FindPoolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"findPool n/Alice"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which subsequently creates `FindPoolCommandParser` class to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then have its `parse()` method invoked to parse the argument `"n/Alice"` and passes it to
   `FindPoolCommandParser`.
1. `FindPoolCommandParser` parses the argument `"n/Alice"` and creates a `PooledPassengerContainsKeywordPredicate` which is returned to the `FindPoolCommandParser`.
1. `FindPoolCommandParser` then creates a `FindPoolCommand`, and provides the newly created `PooledPassengerContainsKeywordPredicate` to it. The `FindPoolCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `FindPoolCommand`, which in turn calls the `updateFilteredPoolList()` method in `Model`, causing the shown pool list to be updated according to the predicate in the `FindPoolCommand` object.
1. A `Pool` object is then created with the list of passengers returned by `getPassengersFromIndexes()`, and then added to the model by the `addPool()` method.
1. Finally, a `CommandResult` would be returned to `LogicManager` to indicate the completion status of the command.

### Find feature

The rationale behind expanding on the find feature is to allow for the user to find passengers by more attributes to improve usability.
Instead of being restricted to searching for names only, the user can now find other passengers with the same day or of a certain area.
This is vital as it is necessary to improve the usability for the user when attempting to find passengers to carpool with drivers.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n/Lucy n/Adam` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  The `command` argument that is passed into
`execute()`, represents the string `"find n/Lucy n/Adam"`, and has been abstracted for readability.
<br>
The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"find n/Lucy n/Adam"` command.
1. Object of `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which then subsequently creates `FindCommandParser` class object to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then invoke the `parse()` method of `FindCommandParser`, with parameters `n/Lucy n/Adam`, to parse the arguments `n/Lucy n/Adam`.
1. `FindCommandParser` parses the arguments `n/Lucy n/Adam` and creates a `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` object named `predicate` which is returned to the `FindCommandParser` object.
1. `FindCommandParser` then instantiates a `FindCommand` object with `predicate` as a parameter. The `FindCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of `FindCommand`, which in turn calls the `updateFilteredPoolList()` method in `Model`, causing the shown pool list to be updated according to `predicate` in the `FindCommand` object.
1. A `CommandResult` object is then created with a message which includes the number of passengers found on the list updated by `updateFilteredPoolList()`.
1. Finally, the `CommandResult` object is returned to `LogicManager`.

### Delete feature

This feature was adapted from AB-3. It allows users to delete `Passengers`.

Design considerations include being able to delete multiple`Passengers` with one command, and prevent the deletion of any `Passengers` that are currently in a `Pool`. This is done to prevent any accidental deletions of `Passengers` without either party being informed.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `delete 1 2` command

![Interactions inslide the Logic Component for the Delete command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"delete 1 2"` command.
1. Object of `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which then subsequently creates `DeleteCommandParser` class object to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then invoke the `parse()` method of `DeleteCommandParser`, with parameters `1 2`.
1. `DeleteCommandParser` invokes the `parseDeleteIndex()` method of `ParserUtil`, with the arguments `"1 2"`, which splits the arguments into tokens via whitespace.
1. `ParserUtil` self invokes `parseIndex()` on each token, which is used for parsing single indexes, and returns all the `Index` objects created to `DeleteCommandParser` as `indexes`.
1. `DeleteCommandParser` then instantiates a `DeleteCommand` object with `indexes` as a parameter. The `DeleteCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of `DeleteCommand`, which in turn calls the `getFilteredPassengerList()` method in `Model`, to get the current passenger list being shown to the user as `lastShownList`.
1. `lastShownList` is then iterated through to and each passenger is passed to `Model` via `hasPoolWithPassenger()`, to check if that passenger is indeed currently being `Pool`ed.
    1. If any `Passenger` is found to be contained in a `Pool`, a new `CommandException` is thrown, informing the user as such.
1. After checking that it is indeed safe to delete all the `Passengers` in `lastShownList`, each `Passenger` is then deleted in `Model` via passing it to the `deletePassenger()` method.
1. A `CommandResult` object is then created with a message which includes the names of the `Passengers` deleted, in `lastShownList`
1. Finally, the `CommandResult` object is returned to `LogicManager`.

## **Appendix: Effort**

The creation of GreenMileageEfforts came with a great deal of effort from each of the team members. Since the start of the project we have
made the effort to consistently conduct team meetings every week, most of these meetings were held in physical settings such that we could communicate our ideas effectively.
Upon completion of the project, we have achieved a product that is a direct reflection of our hard work and determination.
GreenMileageEfforts is a product that has been adapted and morphed from AB3, where there have been significant enhancements made since AB3.

### Challenges faced, Effort and Achievement

The following section describes the challenges our team faced in this project, the efforts we took to overcome it, as well as what we have achieved as a result of the efforts we have taken.

#### Extension of Model

As our group had initially decided on morphing the existing AB3, changes to the model consisted mainly of refactoring existing classes. Although a rather trivial task, this process was rather time-consuming and tedious. Due to the scale of the existing AB3 code, some difficulty was encountered during this refactoring stage as some making seemingly minute changes in method signatures or names would result in a need to edit other segments of affected code. Although the use of IntelliJâ€™s toolbox greatly sped up the process, the nature of some of the refactoring changes we intended to make meant that some of said changes were not as easily detected by IntelliJ, resulting in some uncaught bugs following our refactoring stage. The brownfield nature of the project also led to some difficulty in understanding the model and how the different modules interact with each other.

Towards the end of the first milestone, every team member had a better understanding of the existing code allowing for a better segmentation of work. As this was also the period where new additions were made to the existing AB3 model instead of simple refactoring, there was also less confusion surrounding what components of the model needed to be modified. This was also helped by the fact that in the case of adding features, we had a clearer idea of what needed to be done for the new feature instead of following the trails of an existing one. However, some difficulty was still present as the original AB3 dealt only with a list of one entity(person) while our intended final product would have to handle a list of two entities that interact with each other (Passenger and Pool). These interactions between the two entities led to some difficulty in the implementation of CRUD commands and in coding to avoid too much cyclic dependency.

However, by the end of the second milestone, many of us have a firm grasp of the model and its components. This allowed us to make improvements to not just to the code of the features we had added, but also to the code that was existed in the original AB3.

#### Reworking of `drive` command to `pool` command

The initial concept for this product included two commands `drive` and `undrive` which was later reworked to `pool` and `unpool` after much discussion with the team to better suit the needs of our users.
These changes were made after the addition of a pool list to the model. Prior to the change, the passengers in the model consisted of a driver with a phone number attached to it,
where `drive` was intended to be implemented in a way which merely edits the driver field in each passenger. Likewise, `undrive` was intended to be implemented to edit the driver field within the
specified passengers to be empty. Upon extension of the model to include a list of pools, `pool` was implemented to add a pool to the list, while `unpool` was implemented to delete a pool from the list.
This change involved a significant amount of effort from all of our team members, as the change involved almost all components of the project.
Each team member tested their own component as extensively as possible before integration of the parts together, eventually coming together to fix the bugs that came from integration.
As a result, we have achieved a product that is relatively bug-free and extensible as each component has already be properly tested.

#### Extension and rework of UI

While the user interface of AB3 consists of one panel to illustrate a list of persons, GreenMileageEfforts was required to illustrate a list of passengers as well as a list of pools. This
was not a trivial task, as each of the panels had their own set of commands such as adding, deleting and filtering. On top of that, enhancements were made to ensure a cleaner looking user interface
that is the current GreenMileageEfforts product today.

#### Extension of `find` command

The initial implementation of `find` inherited from AB3 only allowed users to search by names. 
To improve usability for users, we introduced searching of other fields of a passenger. 
While implementing the first iteration in v1.2, it took some additional time as it took some time to understand which classes interacted with each other when `find` was executed.
This was harder to understand as there was no sequence diagram included for the `find` command as well.
To implement the command, a predicate was needed for each of the attributes as well as the parsing of the arguments in `FindCommandParser` to allow for different type of searches to be possible.

#### Extension of `delete` command
The initial implementation of `delete` inherited from AB3 only allowed users to delete 1 passenger at a time. 
To improve usability for users, we introduced multi-passenger deletion using indexes.
The first iteration of this allowed for passengers to be deleted despite some other passengers being already in a pool.
This was later revised to prevent users from executing `delete` all together when there are passengers still in a pool.
This was chosen as better code quality could be achieved through such a decision.

#### Workflow

At the start of the project, work delegation and flow was not ideal, where one team member had to wait for the changes that another had to make.
For instance, while one team member added new fields such as (TripTime and TripDay), another team member was tasked to update the logic of `Add` and `Edit` command for the new fields.
Upon a post-mortem to reflect and evaluate our workflow, we managed to refine our workflow to make it much more efficient by the second milestone, this included the proper
segmentation and delegation of work into its features. Finally, by doing so we have achieved a far better workflow by the end of the project that enabled us to create the GreenMileageEfforts product as it is today.
