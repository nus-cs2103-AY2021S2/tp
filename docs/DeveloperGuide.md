## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At application launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the application consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues with any command.

<img src="images/shion/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component
Figure 4: Class Diagram of UI Component
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_student 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_student 1` Command](images/enhao/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component
 
![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* consists of two main packages:
    * the `Student` package contains classes that represents a student.
    * the `Session` package contains classes that represents a tuition session for each particular student.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* has the ability to save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and parse it back to an object after.
* has the ability to save `Student` objects in JSON format, nested with its associated list of `Session` or `RecurringSession` objects, and parse it back after.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### General
#### List Feature
The list feature displays a list of existing students, and a list of sessions of those students in the TutorBuddy application.

##### Implementation
This feature is facilitated by `ListCommand` which extends `Command`.
The method `ListCommand#execute` updates the filtered student list, and the filtered session list by calling the method
`Model#updateFilteredStudentList` exposed in the `Model` interface.

Given below is an example of how the list student
1. The user executes the list command with the input `list`.
2. `LogicManager` executes the input and parses the command using `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` identifies the correct command and creates a new `ListCommand`.
4. `AddressBookParser` returns the new `ListCommand` to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` executes the `ListCommand`.
6. `ListCommand` now calls `Model` to update the `filteredStudents` and  to show all students.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions when user executes the `list` command:
![ListSequenceDiagram](images/choonwei/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ListCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `list` command.

![ListActivityDiagram](images/choonwei/ListActivityDiagram.png)

### Students
Students in TutorBuddy is facilitated by the `Student` class which stores specific details of
a `student` within one `student` object. Students are not allowed to have duplicated names.

#### Add Student Feature
The add student feature allows user to add a student to the TutorBuddy Application.

##### Implementation
This feature makes use of `AddStudentCommandParser` and `AddStudentCommand` to create a new `Student` object. The operation can be accessed in the Model interface through `Model#addStudent()`.

Given below is an example of how the add student mechanism runs:
1. The user executes the add student command with the command word `add_student` and include all the information required.
2. `LogicManager` starts executing and parses the command using `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` recognises the command and runs the `AddStudentCommandParser` class.
4. `AddStudentCommandParser` then validates the information, and creates a new `Student` object.
5. `AddStudentCommandParser` also creates a new `AddStudentCommand` with the previously created `Student` object as parameter.
6. The command is returned to `LogicManager` which then executes the command.
7. `ModelManager` adds the student to the `AddressBook`.
8. `ModelManager` adds the student to the `filteredStudents` list.
9. `Logic` saves the `AddressBook` data in the `Storage`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `add_student` command.

![AddStudentActivityDiagram](images/enhao/AddStudentActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `add_student` command:
![AddStudentSequenceDiagram](images/enhao/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Delete Student Feature
The delete student feature allows user to delete a student from the TutorBuddy Application.

##### Implementation
The delete student feature is implemented similarly to the add student feature. However, it makes use of the
`DeleteStudentCommandParser` and `DeleteStudentCommand` instead to delete the student from the `AddressBook`. 
The command word to use is `delete_student`. In step 4, TutorBuddy validates the information. In step 7 and 8,
the student is removed from the `UniqueStudentList` list instead.

#### Edit Student Feature
The edit student feature allows user to edit a student profile from the TutorBuddy Application.

##### Implementation
The edit student feature is implemented similarly to the add student feature. However, it makes use of the
`EditStudentCommandParser` and `EditStudentCommand` instead to edit the student from the `AddressBook`.
The command word to use is `edit_student`. In step 4, TutorBuddy validates the information, determine the fields to be edited.
In step 7 and 8, the student is edited and updated to the `UnqiueStudentList` list instead.

#### Find Student Feature
The find student feature allows user to specific keywords in relation to the student's name in the application.
TutorBuddy will then filter the student list based on given keyword.

##### Implementation
The find student feature is implemented similarly to the add student feature. However, it makes use of the
`FindStudentCommandParser` and `FindStudentCommand` instead to update the `filteredStudent` list to only display students with the matching keyword.
The command word to use is `find_student`. In step 4, TutorBuddy validates the information and determine the keywords. 
In step 7 and 8, the `filteredStudents` list is updated based on the given keywords.

#### List Students' Email Feature
The list students' email feature allows the end-user to retrieve a list of students' emails, which are concatenated with
a semi-colon `;`. This allows for quick copying and pasting to e-mail applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, for broadcasting
message purposes (e.g. newsletter).

##### Implementation
This feature is mainly supported by `EmailCommand`, with retrieval of students' emails through the Model interface
`Model#getFilteredStudentList()`.

Below is an example of how the list students' email mechanism works:
1. The user executes the list students' emails command with the command `emails`
2. `LogicManager` receives the command, and hands off the parsing of command to `AddressBookParser`
3. `AddressBookParser` recognises the command and creates a new `EmailCommand`
4. `EmailCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager`, which then executes the command through `EmailCommand#execute()`
5. Upon `EmailCommand#execute()`, a list of `Student` are retrieved through `Model#getFilteredStudentList()`
6. The list of `Student` emails are then concatenated with ';' into a `String`
7. The concatenated `String` is then returned to `LogicManager` as a new `CommandResult`
8. The `CommandResult` containing the concatenated email is then displayed to the user through `ResultDisplay`

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `emails` command:
![EmailCommandActivityDiagram.png](images/sam/EmailCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `emails` command:
![EmailCommandSequenceDiagram.png](images/sam/EmailCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Session
Sessions in TutorBuddy is facilitated by the `Session` class which stores specific details of
a tuition session with one student. Each session is composed within a `Student`,
and a `Student` can have multiple `Session`s.

#### Add Session Feature
The add session feature allows users to add individual tuition sessions with specific details of each session.

This section explains the implementation of the `add_session` mechanism and highlights the design considerations taken into account when implementing this feature.

##### Implementation
The creation of a session is facilitated by `AddSessionCommand` and it extends `Command`. The method,
`AddSessionCommand#execute()`, performs a validity check on student name input and session details input by the user
before adding the session.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the Model and Logic components during the execution of
an `AddSessionCommand` with user input `add_session n/STUDENT_NAME d/DATE t/TIME k/DURATION s/SUBJECT f/FEE`:

![AddSessionSequenceDiagram](images/junwei/AddSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. A new instance of an `AddSessionCommand` would be created by the `AddSessionCommandParser` and returned to `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` encapsulates the `AddSessionCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command execution calls `hasStudent(name)` and `hasSession(name, sessionToAdd)` to validate the inputs before calling
   `addSession(name, sessionToAdd)` which adds the session to the specific student.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the Ui.

Aspect 1: Model for `Session` class
* **Alternative 1(current choice)**: Maintaining a list of session in the `Student` class.
    * Pros:
        * Easy and straightforward implementation
    * Cons:
        * Could potentially hinder performance if there is too much data

* **Alternative 2**: Maintain a two separate lists and have `UniqueStudentList` and `UniqueSessionList`.
    * Pros:
        * Smooth performance when there is a lot of data
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement due to the need for a Universally Unique Identifier(UUID)
    
Alternative 1 was chosen because TutorBuddy is meant to be an application for independent tutors with few students.
However, for future iterations, alternative 2 would be strongly considered.

Aspect 2: Type of input for `AddSessionCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Using student name to identify the student to add the session to.
    * Pros:
        * Easier for user to add sessions without constantly having to refer to the application for student id
    * Cons:
        * Slows down user since name takes longer to type than index.

* **Alternative 2**: Using student index to identify the student to add the session to.
    * Pros:
        * Allows fast entering of input.
    * Cons:
        * User has to constantly refer to the application for student index id.

Alternative 1 was chosen because the cons of implementing alternative 2 outweighs the benefits derived from it. Student index may change when
a user adds a new student into the AddressBook. If the AddressBook contains many students, it may take some time for the user to find the
updated student index. Student name on the other hand, stays constant throughout the application lifetime unless the user edits this information,
which he also has knowledge of. Therefore, student name can be easily entered without reference to the AddressBook, saving much more time compared
to alternative 2.

#### Delete Session Feature
The `DeleteSessionCommand` does the opposite of `AddSessionCommand` -- it calls `Model#deleteSession(studentName, sessionIndex)` instead
which calls `AddressBook#removeSession(studentName, sessionIndex)` and
`UniqueStudentList#deleteSession(targetStudent, sessionIndex)`.

The following sequence diagram shows how deleting a session works:
![DeleteSessionSequenceDiagram](images/shion/DeleteSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

It shares the same design considerations as what is mentioned in Add Session Feature.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
This feature applies to the deletion of an entire recurring session, mentioned below, as well. 
</div>


### Recurring Session
Recurring Session is facilitated by the `RecurringSession` class which stores specific details of
a tuition session with one student, that recurs. Similar to `Session` each recurring session is composed within a `Student`'s list of sessions,
and a `Student` can have multiple `RecurringSession`s. <br>
The class `RecurringSession` inherits from `Session`, albeit with additional properties `Interval` and `LastSessionDate`.
This is because a recurring session can be defined a session that recurs, by given intervals, and up till a last date of session. <br>
![SessionAndRecurringSessionClassDiagram](images/shion/SessionAndRecurringClassDiagram.png) 


Note that:
- `SessionDate` property inherited from `Session`, now serves to represent the date and time of the first occuring session in `RecurringSession`
- Creation of a `RecurringSession` with zero recurrence is not allowed by the user. <br>
  i.e. The first and last dates cannot be the same.<br>
  This is so that from the perspective of the user, the notion of a `Session` and `RecurringSession` will not overlap; 
  a recurring session must strictly recur once or more.
- `delete_session` as mentioned [above](#delete-session-feature) applies on subclass recurring sessions as well, to delete the entire
recurring session.

#### Add Recurring Session Feature
The add recurring session feature allows users to add tuition sessions that recur by a given interval, at least once.

##### Implementation
![AddRecurringSessionSequenceDiagram](images/shion/AddRecurringSessionSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
This is a partial sequence diagram; `AddressBookParser` at the left edge is omitted for brevity <br>
The lifeline for `AddRecurringSessionCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
The process of creating a recurring session and the addition of it to the model component follows the sequence diagram above,
and is described in the following:
1. User input previously parsed is directed to `AddRecurringSessionParser` for further parsing with `#parse(input)`. <br>
After multiple validity checks in the `#parse(input)` method, `AddSessionCommandParser` creates 
   an instance of an `AddRecurringSessionCommand`.
2. `#execute` called on this `AddRecurringSessionCommand` instance calls `hasName(name)`, 
   `hasSession(name, reccuringSessionToAdd)` and `hasOverlappingSession(recurringSessionToAdd)` methods of `Model`
   to ensure that the addition of the recurring session will be valid. 
3. `addSession(name, recurringSessionToAdd)` then adds the recurring session to the specific student in the model component.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object.

The multiple validity checks in `AddRecurringSessionParser#parse(input)` as mentioned in 1. ensures users are guided to
add the compatible recurring session. Determining that a desired recurring session is compatible, and, suggesting a 
compatible recurring session otherwise, is handled through `AddRecurringSessionParser#parse(input)`, with key checks
depicted below.
![AddRecurringSessionCommandParserActivityDiagram](images/shion/AddRecurringSessionCommandParserActivityDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations
Aspect 1: Use of Inheritance for RecurringSession and related classes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Both `RecurringSession` and `RecurringSessionCommand` classes extends 
  `Session` and `SessionCommand` classes
    * Pros:
        * Abides by the "don't repeat yourself" principle, given that the `RecurringSession` is a proper subtype of superclass `Session`.
          Enhancements to recurring session is only additive to superclass `Session`.
        * Reduced complexity. Abstract classes/interfaces are not required with the simple inheritance.
    * Cons:
        * Uses subclass coupling; coupling is increased. Reduces expansion and maintainability, in the possible event
    of redefining recurring session and session relationship.
          
* **Alternative 2**: Creating a `Session (interface)` to be implemented by `Single-Session` class and `RecurringSession`.
    * Pros:
        * Eliminates subclass coupling.
    * Cons:
        * Additional lines of code will be required. At current implementation where `RecurringSession` shares the same logical domain as
    `Session` and is a proper subtype of `Session`, there will comparatively be more repeated code upon abstracting out an interface.
          
Alternative 1 was chosen for the practical consideration that less code was necessary for the forseeable requirements
given the current set of use cases. Though increasing coupling, the inheritance relationship is simple and sufficient,
as methods to `RecurringSession` is strictly only additive to those is `Session`. The increased coupling does not
complicated testing as well, due to the fact that every test on `Session` applies to `RecurringSession`.


Aspect 2: Brute vs. mathematical implementation for overlap checks involving recurring sessions in isOverlapping()
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Brute-force approach to checking for overlap with recurring sessions.
    * Pros:
        * Logically simple, hence easy to implement, test, review.
    * Cons:
        * Worst case scenario has no bounds.

* **Alternative 2**: Mathematical approach to checking for overlap with recurring session, using ideas of GCD
  and extended euclid algorithm
    * Pros:
        * Fixed upper bound to amount of computation; better (bounded) worst case.
    * Cons:
        * Not straightforward, may require domain-specific knowledge, i.e. Math
    
Alternative 1 was chosen as a worst case scenario that harms is effectively non-existent.
Realistic, practical user inputs will involve recurrence intervals that can be perceived by the human brain of the
user; this will not cause computations that give significant run-time, even when approach is burte.
Alternative 2 would require formal verification, which can be time-consuming.

#### Delete Recurring Session Feature
The delete recurring session feature allows users to remove a single session from an existing recurring session.

This section explains the implementation of the `delete_rec_session` command and highlights the design considerations
taken into account when implementing this feature.

##### Implementation

The deletion of a single session in an existing recurring session is facilitated by the `DeleteRecurringSessionCommand` and it extends `Command`.
The method `DeleteRecurringSessionCommand#execute()` performs a validity check on the student name, target index, and session date to be deleted
before deleting the single session.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the Model and Logic components during the execution of a `DeleteRecurringSessionCommand`
with user input `delete_rec_session n/STUDENT_NAME i/SESSION_INDEX d/DATE`:
![DeleteSessionSequenceDiagram](images/choonwei/DeleteRecurringSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteRecurringSessionCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. A new instance of a `DeleteRecurringSessionCommand` would be created by the `DeleteRecurringSessionCommandParser` and returned to `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` encapsulates the `DeleteRecurringSessionCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The execution calls `hasName(studentName)` to validate an existing student in TutorBuddy, and `hasSessionOnDate(sessionDate)` to validate
   the session date belongs to a recurring session.
5. It also calls `getStudentWithName(studentName)` to get the student name before calling `deleteSessionInRecurringSession(studentName, targetIndex, sessionDate)`
which splits the recurring session into two recurring session(s)/session(s), one exclusively before the session date, and another exclusively after the session date.
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the Ui to display the updated list of sessions.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `delete_rec_session` command.
![ListActivityDiagram](images/choonwei/DeleteRecurringSessionActivityDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations
Aspect 1: Exclusion of the single session from the recurring session
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Splits the recurring session into two recurring session(s)/session(s), one
  exclusively before the session date, and another exclusively after the session date.
    * Pros:
        * Easier for user to keep track of their sessions since they only need to read the start and end date of the recurring sessions.
        * Easier to handle session entries when displaying recurring sessions in `Calendar`, `Reminders`, and `Fees` components.
    * Cons:
        * More work required for TutorBuddy to execute the splitting of sessions.

* **Alternative 2**: Store a `List<SessionDate>` inside of each `Session` for excluded sessions.
    * Pros:
        * Allows quick exclusion of session dates since we only need to store the session date in the session.
    * Cons:
        * Requires a lot of book-keeping when displaying recurring sessions in `Calendar`, `Reminders`, and `Fees` components.
        * Tedious for user to keep track of their sessions by regularly checking if the date is excluded.
    
Alternative 1 was chosen because of the pros of implementing alternative 1 outweighs the cons that comes along with it.
Although it requires TutorBuddy to do more of the processing work to split the recurring session, it makes it easier to
display recurring sessions in the Calendar view, display upcoming recurring sessions in reminders, and calculation of fees.
It also makes it more intuitive and convenient for the user to see if a recurring session occurs on a certain date without
having to check if the date is excluded when they refer to the `Tuition` page.

### Monthly Fees
Monthly Fees in TutorBuddy is calculated based on the session `fee`. It makes uses of the FeeUtil static method
to perform the calculation.

#### Calculating Monthly Fee Feature
The monthly `fee` feature allows user to quickly calculate the amount of money they should have received
from a particular student in a given month and year.

This section explains the implementation of the `fee` command and highlights the design considerations taken into account when implementing this feature.

##### Implementation
The calculation of the fees is facilitated by the `GetMonthlyFeeCommand` and it extends `Command`. The method,
`GetMonthlyFeeCommand#execute()`, performs a validity check on student name input to ensure that the student name exists in the application.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the Model, Logic and FeeUtil components during the execution of
an `GetMonthlyFeeCommand` with user input `fee n/STUDENT_NAME m/MONTH y/YEAR`:

![GetMonthlyFeeSequenceDiagram](images/enhao/GetMonthlyFeeSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. A new instance of an `GetMonthlyFeeCommand` would be created by the `GetMonthlyFeeCommandParser` and returned to `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` encapsulates the `AddSessionCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command execution calls `hasStudent(name)` to validate the inputs.
5. The command execution the calls the `getFeePerStudent(student, startPeriod, endPeriod)` static method in `FeeUtil` and perform the calculation.  
6. The calculation result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

#### Design Considerations
Aspect 1: Calculation for the fees
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Abstracting out the calculation to a common file such as `FeeUtil`.
    * Pros:
        * Ensures the "don't repeat yourself" software development principle by allowing both this command, and the 3 monthly fee feature to make use of the same methods in `FeeUtil`.
        * Potentially easier to be maintained by further developer.
    * Cons:
        * Increases coupling.

* **Alternative 2**: Performing the calculation inside `GetMonthlyFeeCommand`.
    * Pros:
        * Reduces coupling.
    * Cons:
        * Repeated code and increased difficult for maintenance when there is a need to update the calculation algorithm.

Alternative 1 was chosen because the pros of implementing alternative 1 outweighs the cons derived from it. By having
an abstracted `FeeUtil` method, we will only need to update the methods in `FeeUtil` which will have a rippling effect
to the rest of the features that uses this method. This allows the UI to make use of the `FeeUtil` methods when calculating the 
3 months fees as well. Although this results in increased coupling, with proper testing in place, we could mitigate the risk 
as we ensure that changes in the `FeeUtil` method do not unintentionally changes the behaviour of the other feature.
