## **Design**

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Blacklist feature
The blacklist mechanism is facilitated by `Person`.
It represents if a `Person` is blacklisted or not, stored internally by adding a `Blacklist` object to the parameters of `Person`.
Blacklist status is displayed externally via the background colour of a contact (black represents blacklisted, non-black represents un-blacklisted).

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person.
A new `Person` is created, with the default status of un-blacklisted.
It is then added to `AddressBook`.

![BlacklistState1](images/BlacklistState1.png)

Step 2. The user decides to blacklist the person, and executes the `blist INDEX` command.
The `blist INDEX` command will create a new `Person` with the same information as the person at `INDEX` in `AddressBook`,
but with a new `Blacklist` with a different blacklist status, which then replaces the original person.

![BlacklistState2](images/BlacklistState2.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the blacklist operation works:

![BlacklistSequenceDiagram](images/BlacklistSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a blacklist command:

![BlacklistActivityDiagram](images/BlacklistActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: The command format of blacklist

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `blist INDEX` to toggle blacklist status.
    * Pros: Easier to remember, faster to type.
            More straightforward and logical for a value with only 2 states.
    * Cons: Requires checking current blacklist status.

* **Alternative 2:** `+blist INDEX` to blacklist, `-blist INDEX` to un-blacklist.
    * Pros: Able to directly set blacklist status without checking current status.
    * Cons: More commands to remember.

### Collect feature
The collect feature is facilitated by `CommandResult`, which is responsible for displaying the results after
collecting the details. Currently, only details from the 4 main fields (name, phone, address, email)
can be collected.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `collect` command works.

![CollectSequenceDiagram](images/CollectSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: The number of fields to be collected from

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Exactly 1 field out of 4 possible choices.
    * Pros: Simpler and more intuitive command format.
      Usually only 1 field is needed at a time when copying to messaging applications.
    * Cons: Not customisable for all needs.

* **Alternative 2:** Exactly 1 field out of all existing fields.
    * Pros: Able to be used for more situations.
    * Cons: More complex command format for likely unnecessary details.

##### Aspect: The ability to start or end the separator with blank space

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Leading or trailing blank space is ignored.
    * Pros: Easier to implement due to reuse of `ArgumentTokenizer`.
      Blank space is not the main separator in the recipient list for most messaging applications,
      so functionality is not significantly impacted.
    * Cons: Collected details are not in reader-friendly format.

* **Alternative 2:** Include all leading and trailing blank spaces
    * Pros: Able to be used for more situations.
    * Cons: More complicated implementation resulting in possibly more bugs.

### Finding contacts by details
This feature is built on the current `find` command, which is used to be limited to only finding persons by names. With this change, the format of the `find` command is now modified to `find n/[NAME] t/[TAG] a/[ADDRESS] p/[PHONE] e/[EMAIL] b/[IS_BLACKLISTED] m/[MODE_OF_CONTACT]`.
This command returns the persons with attributes that matches at least one of the attributes of interest (See User Guide for more details).
Note that users are only required to provide at least one of the parameters to use this command. In other words, commands such as `find n/Alex` and `find t/autistic` are valid commands.

To facilitate the implementation of this feature, several new predicate classes are introduced, for instance, `PersonTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ReturnTruePredicate` etc. Of course, As the name suggests, `ReturnTruePredicate` always returns `true`.

The introduction of `ReturnTruePredicate` may seem pointless, but it is of great use. The key here is to realize that if X is a boolean variable, then X `and` `true` simplifies to X. If all keywords are given, the `FindCommand` class will receive all the predicates. If, say, only `name` keywords are given, then rest of the predicates will be replaced with `ReturnTruePredicate`s. As such, the filter will now solely depend on `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` since the other predicates always returns
true.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` command works:<br>
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when `find` command is executed.<br>
![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Command design

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `find` command alone supports finding by the different fields.
    * Pros: More intuitive to use since most commands have similar format. Makes further extensions easier as developers only need to define a new predicate class.
    * Cons: Can make debugging harder since further extensions are centralized into one class.

* **Alternative 2:** Find by names and find by tags are separate commands.
    * Pros: Easier to debug as one command is meant for one criterion.
    * Cons: It is now not possible to combine both criteria together. More commands to remember. Due to similarity of the commands, they can be confused from one another.

### Light Feature

The light feature is implemented in the `LightCommand` class.
The following is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `light` to switch the current theme to a light theme.
The `UI` component then passes the string to the `LogicManager` class in `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component executes the command which changes the boolean light to true. This is passed back to the `UI` component.

Step 3: The `UI` component loads the fxml file containing the light theme and is displayed back to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the light command works:

![LightSequenceDiagram](images/LightSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes the light command:

![LightActivityDiagram](images/LightActivityDiagram.png)

### Dark Feature

The dark feature is implemented in the `DarkCommand` class.
The following is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `dark` to switch the current theme to a dark theme.
The `UI` component then passes the string to the `LogicManager` class in `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component executes the command which changes the boolean dark to true. This is passed back to the `UI` component.

Step 3: The `UI` component loads the fxml file containing the dark theme and is displayed back to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the dark command works:

![DarkSequenceDiagram](images/DarkSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes the dark command:

![DarkActivityDiagram](images/DarkActivityDiagram.png)

### Mode of Contact feature
The mode of contact feature is built on the current `AddCommand` class.
The following is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `add n/Bob …/m email …` to add a new Person with the mode of contact as `email`.
The `UI` component then passes the string to the `LogicManager` class in `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component parses the string and creates an `AddCommand` object.

Step 3: The `LogicManager` class then executes the `AddCommand` object, which calls all the appropriate methods including `mode of contact` in the `Model` component.

Step 4: The `Model` component adds the inputted string and the appropriate method in the `Storage` component is executed to update the file.

Step 5: The `Model` component passes the `CommandResult` to the `Logic` component, which is then passed to the `UI` component to display to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works:
![ModeOfContactSequenceDiagram](images/ModeOfContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Mass Blacklist feature
The mass blacklist/un-blacklist mechanism is facilitated by `MassBlacklistCommand`.
Below is an example usage scenario for mass blacklist.

Step 1: The user executes `massblist 2-5 b/blacklist` to blacklist all contacts within the index range 2-5.
The string is passed to the `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component parses the string and creates a corresponding `MassBlacklistCommand` object.

Step 3: The `MassBlacklistCommand` object calls `Model#massBlacklist(2,5)` to blacklist all contacts
in the `AddressBook` with index between 2 to 5.

Step 4: After the contacts have been blacklisted, `filteredPersons` in `ModelManager` is updated to reflect the change.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mass blacklist operation works:
![MassBlacklistSequenceDiagram](images/MassBlacklistSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MassBlacklistCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a mass blacklist command:
![MassBlacklistActivityDiagram](images/MassBlacklistActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Inheritance or no inheritance with `MassDeleteCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement `MassBlacklistCommand` as a separate class.
  * Pros: Easier to implement. Code is also shorter.
  * Cons: This implementation is difficult to extend to other mass operations in the future.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a `MassCommand` class and let `MassBlacklistCommand` and `MassDeleteCommand` inherit from
  `MassCommand`.
  * Pros: Certain parts of the code can be reused for other mass operation commands in the future.
  * Cons: `MassBlacklistCommand` and `MassDeleteCommand` differ in significant ways and only a small portion of the code
    is shared. This implementation makes the code much longer and adds even more classes to the
    commands package.
  
### Mass Delete feature
The mass delete mechanism is facilitated by `MassDeleteCommand`.
Below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `massdelete 2-5` to delete all contacts within the index range 2-5.
The string is passed to the `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component parses the string and creates a corresponding `MassDeleteCommand` object.

Step 3: The `MassDeleteCommand` object calls `Model#massDelete(2,5)` to delete all contacts
in the `AddressBook` with index between 2 to 5.

Step 4: After deletion, `filteredPersons` in `ModelManager` is updated to reflect the change.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mass delete operation works:
![MassDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/MassDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MassDeleteCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a mass delete command:
![MassDeleteActivityDiagram](images/MassDeleteActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Input format
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Input format is `massdelete START-END`.
    * Pros: More inutitive for the user.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement as new methods will have to be written to parse the hyphen (-) symbol.

* **Alternative 2:** Input format is `massdelete start/START end/END`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement as the existing `ArgumentMultimap` and `CliSyntax` classes are
      well-suited to parse such input formats.
    * Cons: There are more prefixes for the user to remember.

### Remark feature
The Remark feature is facilitated by the classes `Remark` and `RemarkCommand`.
Below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `add n/John Doe...` to add a new contact. This creates a new `Person` object. By default,
the new contact is displayed as having "No remark".

![RemarkState1](images/RemarkState1.png)

Step 2: The user now decides to add a new remark to the new contact by executing `remark 3 r/Absent`.
The `Logic` component creates a new `RemarkCommand` object for execution.

Step 4: `RemarkCommand` creates a new `Person` object which is identical to the original `Person` object in
every field except that the `Remark` of the new `Person` object have been updated.

![RemarkState2](images/RemarkState2.png)

Step 5: `RemarkCommand` calls `Model#setPerson()` to replace the original `Person` in the `AddressBook` with the new
`Person`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a remark command:
![RemarkActivityDiagram](images/RemarkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Implementation of remark
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Editing the `Remark` field is done in a separate command.
    * Pros: Reduces coupling and increases abstraction. Code for the `Remark` command can be reused elsewhere.
    * Cons: More commands for the user to remember.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the existing `Edit` command to edit the `Remark` field.
    * Pros: Easier to implement as the edit command already has a parser and many helper methods.
    * Cons: The edit command is already the largest class in the `commands` package. Adding more code will make the
      class even bigger and thus more difficult to maintain.

### Navigate previous commands feature

#### Implementation

The implementation of this feature is facilitated by `CommandList` class, which is a self-implemented linked list class.
Whenever a command is executed, regardless of validity, a new node containing the command will be created and added into the linked list.
The nodes in the linked list are implemented using `CommandNode` class, which keeps track of the following information:

* Command executed
* A reference to the previous `CommandNode` in the linked list.
* A reference to the next `CommandNode` in the linked list.

In addition, a `cursor` is introduced in `CommandList` class to help with navigation of the commands.
The `cursor` keeps track of the current command while users are traversing through the commands using up and down arrow keys.
Its position will be reset to the newly added `CommandNode`, which is the last node in the list, once a new command has been executed.

When the user presses the up arrow key, there are two possible scenarios:
* The `cursor` is at the first node in the list.
    * Nothing happens.
* The `cursor` is not at the first node in the list.
    * The `cursor` is moved to the previous node and a new command is retrieved.

![NavPrevCommandsADUp](images/NavigatingPrevCommandsActivityDiagramUp.png)

Similarly, when the user presses the down arrow key, there are two possible scenarios:
* The `cursor` is at the last node in the list.
    * Nothing happens.
* The `cursor` is not at the last node in the list.
    * The `cursor` is moved to the next node and a new command is retrieved.

![NavPrevCommandsADUp](images/NavigatingPrevCommandsActivityDiagramDown.png)

#### Design considerations:

#### Aspect: Data structure used to model the list of commands

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Use a self-implemented linked list.
    * Pros: More control on the implementation. Cursor lies on the element themselves.
    * Cons: Higher chance of errors in implementation, especially when it comes to addition of nodes.
* **Alternative 2**: Use the `LinkedList` class provided by Java.
    * Pros: Easier implementation. Most operations have been provided by Java.
    * Cons: Need to devise a workaround to traverse the commands since the `ListIterator` places the cursor in between the elements.

### Sort feature
The sort mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand`.
Below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `sort ascending` to sort the contact list by name in ascending order. The
string is passed to the `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component parses the string and creates a corresponding `SortCommand` object.

Step 3: The `SortCommand` object calls `Model#sortByName()` to sort the
internal `AddressBook`.

Step 4: After sorting, `filteredPersons` in `ModelManager` is updated to reflect the change.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the sort operation works:
![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort command:
![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Sort input format
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `sort ascending` and `sort descending`
  * Pros: Easier for the user to remember.
  * Cons: Difficult to extend the command to accept more parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** `sort d/ascending` and `sort d/descending`
  * Pros: This implementation makes it easier to extend the command in the future to accept more parameters. For example, `sort
    c/modeofcontact c/name d/descending` is a possible format that can be used to sort the list firstly by mode of contact then by name in
    descending order.
  * Cons: Not as user friendly as the user will have to remember more commands.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `State` class. It contains a list of `AddressBookCommandPair`s, which are made up of the state of `AddressBook` and the command executed.
They are stored internally as `addressBookStates`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `State#addState()` — Saves a new `AddressBookCommandPair` in its history.
* `State#deleteState()` — Deletes the last `AddressBookCommandPair` in the list. The undo operation is done by calling this method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `State` will be initialized with the initial `AddressBookCommandPair`. Since no command is executed, the command stored in the pair will be an empty string.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the contact list. After execution, `State#addState()` is called, causing the modified state of the contact list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStates`.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. This causes another modified contact list state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution or does not modify the contact list in anyway, it will not call `State#addState()`, so the contact list state will not be saved into the `addressBookStates`.
Examples of commands that do not modify the list include <code>find</code>, <code>list</code> etc.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will first call `State#deletePreviousState()` to delete `pair2` and then call `model#setAddressBook` to set the contact list to be the same `AddressBook` as in `pair1`.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If there is only one state saved in the <code>addressBookStates</code>, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `State#getPreviousState` to check if this is the case. If so, the method will return <code>null</code>
, causing the command to return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire contact list.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Value proposition**: OCA has a wide range of information to disseminate
to students / staff at NUS. The large number of emails to send, and the large
student / staff population may introduce errors during dissemination.
We aim to help them classify this information based on the relevant parties
and the required means of communication.
