## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of
each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML
Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit
diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and
exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc and a `ReviewMode` that is made up of parts `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `FlashcardViewCard` . All these, including the `MainWindow` and `ReviewMode`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `ReviewMode` can be accessed from `MainWindow` through `review` command. The `MainWindow` can be accessed from `ReviewMode` through `q` command.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FlashBackParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a new card).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
   help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to plantUML automatic placement of elements, some multiplicities are in the wrong position.

</div>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the FlashBack data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the FlashBack data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.flashback.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Sort feature
The sort mechanism is managed by `ModelManager`. As `Flashcard` contains `Question` and `Priority`, these are utilised along with the enum `SortOptions` which
comprises comparators needed for respective sort options.

It implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#SortFilteredCardList(Comparator<Flashcard> cmp)` - Sorts the flashcard list
according to an option and shows the updated list.
* `SortOptions#getOption(String option)` - Returns the enum according to the specified option

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application.

Step 2. User executes `sort priority -d`. This command get parsed and 
`Model#sortFilteredFlashcardList` is called with the respective comparator, 
resulting in flashcards sorted by decreasing priority.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the sort function operates:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### \[Implemented\] Review feature
The review mechanism is managed by `ReviewManager`. It 
maintains a list of `Flashcard` and `currentIndex` internally. In addition, it involves the UI through `ReviewMode` that handles user inputs and displays flashcards to users.
 
 `ReviewManager` implements the following operations:
 * `ReviewManager#getFlashcardDeckSize()` - Returns the size of the current list of flashcards.
 * `ReviewManager#hasNextFlashcard()` - Checks if there is a flashcard after the current flashcard.
 * `ReviewManager#hasPreviousFlashcard()` - Checks if there is a flashcard before the current flashcard.
 * `ReviewManager#getCurrentFlashcard()` - Returns the flashcard at `currentIndex` of the flashcard list.
 * `ReviewManager#updateCardCorrect(Flashcard cardToUpdate)` - Updates the statistics of a specified `cardToUpdate` when user answers the question correctly.
 * `ReviewManager#updateCardWrong(Flashcard cardToUpdate)` - Updates the statistics of a specified `cardToUpdate` when user answers the question wrongly.
 
 The following class diagram illustrates how classes involved in this feature interact with each other: <br><br>
 ![ReviewClassDiagram](images/ReviewClassDiagram.png) <br><br>
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the review mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1: The user launches the application.

Step 2: The user enters `review` command in `CommandBox`. After the logic executes the command, it returns a `CommandResult` to the `MainWindow` where the `CommandResult#isReviewMode()` method returns true. After that, a `MainWindow#enterReviewMode()` method is called and user enters `ReviewMode`.

Step 3: Depending on the command that user enters in the `CommandBox` of `ReviewMode`, different methods in `ReviewManager` are called to handle user inputs.

Step 4: If the user enters `q` in the `CommandBox`, `ReviewMode#handleQuitCommand` method is called, and the user returns back to the `MainWindow`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the user enter `ReviewMode`: <br>
![ReviewSequenceDiagram](images/ReviewSequenceDiagram.png) <br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CommandResult` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How user interacts in Review Mode.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** interacts via `CommandBox` similar to the `MainWindow`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: User experience might not be good since user needs to type many commands.

* **Alternative 2:** interacts via keyboard
    * Pros: Better user experience since user can move to next/previous flashcard a lot faster.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

### \[Implemented\] Statistics feature

The statistics feature is supported by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`.

To show flashcard statistics, `LogicManager` first calls `FlashBackParser#parseCommand` to parse through user input.
If user input is recognized as a command to display statistics, `StatsCommandParser#parse` is invoked to create
a new `StatsCommand` object.

The `StatsCommand` is then executed:
* The current flashcard list is obtained from the `ModelManager`.


* If a valid flashcard index is included in the user input, the flashcard
identified by the provided index is retrieved from the current flashcard list, and the statistics associated with the card is obtained by
`Flashcard#getStats()`.


* If the flashcard index is omitted from the user input. A new `Statistics` object is created, representing the
overall statistics of the current flashcard list.


A `CommandResult` is created with the generated flashcard `Statistics`. It is then passed to `MainWindow`, where
the UI is updated to display the retrieved statistics.

Example: `stats 3` is entered by the user

It implements the following operations:

* `StatsCommandParser.parse(String command)` - Parses through user input and returns an executable `StatsCommand`.
* `ModelManager#getFilteredFlashcardList()` - Retrieves the current flashcard list.
* `Flashcard#getStats()` - Retrieves statistics of the flashcard at index 3 of the list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this scenario.

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `StatsCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### \[Implemented\] Undo/redo feature
The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFlashBack`. It extends `FlashBack` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `flashBackStates` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedFlashBack#commit()` â€” Saves the current flashback state in its history.
* `VersionedFlashBack#undo()` â€” Restores the previous flashback state from its history.
* `VersionedFlashBack#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone flashback state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFlashBack()`, `Model#undoFlashBack()`
and `Model#redoFlashBack()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFlashBack` will be initialized with the
initial flashback state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single flashback state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th flashcard in flashback. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitFlashBack()`, causing the modified state of the flashback after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `flashBackStates`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted flashback
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add q/What is recursion? â€¦â€‹` to add a new flashcard. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitFlashBack()`
, causing another modified flashback state to be saved into the `flashBackStates`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFlashBack()`, so the flashback state will not be saved into the `flashBackStates`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the flashcard was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFlashBack()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous flashback state, and restores the flashback to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial FlashBack state, then there are no previous FlashBack states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFlashBack()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoFlashBack()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the flashback to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `flashBackStates.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest flashback state, then there are no undone FlashBack states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFlashBack()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `view 4`. Commands that do not modify flashback, such
as `view 2`, will usually not call `Model#commitFlashBack()`, `Model#undoFlashBack()` or `Model#redoFlashBack()`.
Thus, the `flashBackStates` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFlashBack()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `flashBackStates`, all flashback states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add q/What is recursion? â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire FlashBack.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Implemented\] Filter feature

The implemented filter mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`. The user inputs the filter 
command with specified fields (e.g. question, category, priority, and tag), the `LogicManager` receives and parse this 
input, and the `ModelManager` updates FlashBack with a list of filtered flashcards matching all specified fields.

The filter command is executed by parsing the user input through `FlashBackParser#parseCommand(String userInput)`, which 
continues to parse the user input through `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)`. This creates a new `FilterCommand` 
object that takes in a `FlashcardFilterPredicate` object.

The `FlashcardFilterPredicate` class implements `Predicate<Flashcard>` and takes in:
* `List<String> questions` â€” List of question keywords to filter by.
* `List<String> categories` â€” List of category keywords to filter by.
* `List<String> priorities` â€” List of priority keywords to filter by.
* `List<String> tags` â€” List of tag keywords to filter by.
  
The filter feature implements the following operations:
* `FilterCommand#execute(Model model)` â€” executes filter function to update `Model` to display filtered flashcards.
* `FlashcardFilterPredicate#test(Flashcard flashcard)` â€” Compares the flashcard fields with user specified filter fields
  and returns true only if the flashcard fields matches all the user specified filter fields.
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredFlashcardList(Predicate<Flashcard> predicate)` â€” Updates the predicate of 
  `FilteredList<Flashcard> filteredFlashcards` field in `ModelManager`.
  
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application that contains existing flashcards.

Step 2. The user executes `filter q/formula p/mid` command to filter and display all flashcards that have both `formula`
contained in its question field and `mid` in its priority field. The `LogicManager#execute(String commandText)` is
called, which then calls the `FlashBackParser#parseCommand(String userInput)` to parse the user input. This would result
in calling `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` to further parse the user input.

Step 3. `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` parse the user input, creating four lists of keywords, one for
each specified field. A `FlashcardFilterPredicate` object would be created using these four lists, and this 
`FlashcardFilterPredicate` would be used to create and return a `FilterCommand` object.

Step 4. After returning the `FilterCommand` object to the `LogicManager`, `FilterCommand#execute(Model model)` is called.

Step 5. `FilterCommand#execute(Model model)` then calls 
`ModelManager#updateFilteredFlashcardList(Predicate<Flashcard> predicate)` which will update the predicate of 
`FilteredList<Flashcard> filteredFlashcards` field in `ModelManager`.

Step 6. FlashBack is then updated with the new filtered flashcard list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Find feature

* Challenge was to use multiple keywords provided by user, look through every field of the flashcard, and displaying any flashcards that have any fields (e.g. question, answer, category, priority, tags) matching any of the provided keywords.
* AB3 have a `find` feature, but it was only able to search by names and did not have the ability to search through all fields.
* Enhanced the feature to allow users to search for flashcards using multiple keywords matching any of its fields.
* With reference from the `find` feature available in AB3, learnt and implemented the feature to search through all fields.

### Filter feature

* Challenge was to parse user input with multiple specified fields (e.g. question, category, priority, tags) regardless of order with multiple keywords, and only displaying flashcards that matched the keywords of all specified fields.
* AB3 did not have a `filter` feature.
* Implemented the `filter` feature to allow users to filter flashcards matching the specified fields with multiple keywords.
* With little reference from the `find` and `add` feature available in AB3, learnt and implemented the feature to match all specified fields.

### View feature
* The challenge was to redesign the Main Window, from just 3 main components in AB3: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `PersonListPanel` to 4 components in `FlashBack`: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `FlashcardListPanel` and `FlashcardViewPanel`.
* We first need to divide the Main Window into 2 columns: The second one is for displaying the flashcard list. The first column is further divided into 3 rows: The first row is the `CommandBox`, the second is the `ResultDisplay` and the last one is `FlashcardViewPanel`.

### Review Mode
* This is a totally new feature relative to AB3.
* This feature mostly involved in UI work since a completely new window must be created from the beginning.
* A new class called `ReviewManager` is created to handle the logic for this mode.

### UI improvement
* There is a significant change from the initial UI of AB3 to the final UI to make the application more visually appealing.
* We considered many color choices and UI design and actively asked for feedback from all members in the team and some of our friends also to reach the finalized design for the UI.
* The `CommandBox` is changed so that the input can be split into multiple line, which increases the readability for the user. Although the code for the custom command box came from an online source, it was extremely difficult to find this source code.
