## **Introduction**
Focuris is a desktop application for managing events with a KanBan board, which is a board where your events displayed 
according to the level of completion of each event, which consists of Backlog, Todo, In-Progress and Done. It functions
via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows more efficient management of events.

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## **Design**

### Architecture

![Architecture_Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

### **Overall Components**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![interact_with_each_other](diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](diagrams/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- `HelpWindow` will only be shown when executing the `help` command.
- `KanbanPanel` is displayed as the default view.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `EventBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a todo event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
- stores the event book data.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

- can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
- can save the event book data in JSON format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.focuris.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Priority feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The priority feature is an additional field in the Event class. It is implemented as an enumeration named EventPriority and consists of
a set of members named HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW. If the User decides not to add a priority to an event, LOW will be assigned as the default priority.

The following class diagram illustrates how the priority feature is implemented:

![Structure of the Event Component](diagrams/EventClassDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Optional Priority

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set LOW as the default priority

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: Events would have an additional field for priority even if there is no priority.
    May increase memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Include an additional constructor that takes in priority as an additional argument.
  - Pros: Will use less memory when no priority is assigned.
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct and uses the right constructor.

### Glossary

**Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

**Event**: A task that needs to be completed by the user. 
- An event consists of a title, description and identifier that we use 
  to track each event. 
- The stage of completion of an event can be split into four types: 
    1) Backlog
    2) Todo
    3) In Progress
    4) Done
- An event can also have three different degrees of priorities:
    1) High
    2) Medium
    3) Low
     
**Backlog**: A set of events that the user has agreed to work on next. This could be events that are currently being 
planned to be worked on or pending or any upcoming events, but we leave the definition loose up to the user.

**Todo**: A set of events that the user has to work on as effective of immediately or have been delegated to already. 
We leave the definition loose up to the user.

**In Progress**: A set of events that the user is currently working on. We leave the definition loose up to the user.

**Done**: A set of events that the user has completed. This could be events that are currently being 
planned to be worked on or pending, but we leave the definition loose up to the user.
     
**Kanban**: Meaning signboard or billboard in Japanese. It is a method of managing and improving work flow across human
systems. It is often used via a Kanban Board, where cards are used to represent work items and columns are used to 
represent each stage of the work process. An example of a Kanban Board is our application itself.

     
**Sprint**: A time-boxed iteration of a continuous development cycle, where a planned amount of work is completed by the team.
