## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PassengerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a passenger).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1 2")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1 2` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the GME terminal data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Passenger>` and `ObservableList<Pool>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Passenger` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Passenger` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Pool feature
This feature allows users to create and add a pool to the list of pools, through the use of a `pool` command.

Design considerations include the `pool` command being able to be used in conjunction with the `find` command. For instance, the user would
first use `find tag/female` and then followed by `pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/MONDAY t/1930 c/2 c/3`.
The `find tag/female` command first filters the list of displayed passengers, such that only passengers with the `female` tag would be displayed. Calling the `pool` command
would then assign `Alice` with number `91234567` to be the driver of the passengers specified by the indices for the currently displayed list.

The activity diagram below encapsulates the user workflow of adding passengers, finding passengers and then pooling the passengers:

![Activity Diagram for a User Using Pool](images/PoolActivityDiagram.png)

The rationale behind this implementation was because once the GME terminal is populated with a large number of passengers, it would be rather difficult for the user to find a specific passenger.
By allowing the user to first filter the passengers then subsequently pooling from the filtered list would greatly enhance the feature, thereby making the product much more cohesive as features work well together.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3")` command.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3` Command](images/PoolSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  The `command` argument that is passed into
`execute()`, represents the string `"pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3"`, and has been abstracted for readability.
<br>
The lifeline for `PoolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"pool n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then instantiated, which subsequently instantiates `PoolCommandParser` class to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then have its `parse()` method invoked to parse the arguments of `"n/Alice p/91234567 d/monday t/1930 c/2 c/3"` to
   `PoolCommandParser` which creates and returns a `PoolCommand`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `PoolCommand`, which in turn calls its own method of `getPassengersFromIndexes()` 
   that gets a list of passengers from `Model` by calling `getFilteredPassengerList()`.
1. A `Pool` object is then created with the list of passengers returned by `getPassengersFromIndexes()`, and then added to the model by the `addPool()` method.
1. The model filtered pool list is then updated with `updateFilteredPoolList()` with a predicate to show all pools in the list `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_POOLS`.
1. Finally, a `CommandResult` would be returned back to `LogicManager` to indicate the completion status of the command.

It is worth noting that in the case of adding a passenger, a `Passenger` object is created by `AddCommandParser` and used in the constructor of `AddCommand`.
However, in the case of adding a pool, a `PoolCommand` is constructed using the details specified and parsed from `PoolCommandParser`, instead of creating and passing a `Pool` object.
The rationale is due the fact that a list of passengers have to be obtained from the indexes specified, which requires interactions with the model.
The current implementation thus encapsulates all the interactions with model, within the methods of `PoolCommand`.

### Unpool feature
This feature allows users to remove a pool from the pool list through the specification of an index.

Design considerations include the `findPool` command being able to be used in conjunction with the `unpool` command. For instance, the user might first use `findPool n/Alice` and then followed by `unpool 1`.
The `findPool n/Alice` command first filters the list of displayed pools, such that only pools in which there is a passenger named Alice will be displayed. Calling the `unpool` command would then remove the pool specified by the provided indices from the currently displayed list, removing it from the system. The `findPool` command works similarly to the `find` command, except that it currently only supports the use of the name prefix: "/n"

The activity diagram below encapsulates the user workflow of adding passengers, finding passengers and then pooling the passengers:

![Activity Diagram for a user using Unpool](images/UnpoolActivityDiagram.png)

The rationale behind this implementation was because once the GME terminal is populated with a large number of pools, it would be rather difficult for the user to find a specific pool with a specific passenger.
By allowing the user to first filter the pools before subsequently removing the pool from the filtered list, the findPool feature greatly enhances the unpool feature, thereby making the product much more cohesive as features work well together.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("unpool 1")`.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `unpool 1` Command](images/UnpoolSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UnpoolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"unpool 1"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then instantiated, which subsequently instantiates `UnpoolCommandParser` class to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then have its `parse()` method invoked, passing the argument `"1"` to `UnpoolCommandParser`.
1. Given that the index `"1"` is a valid index, an `UnpoolCommand` object would be created and returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `UnpoolCommand` which in turn invokes `deletePool()` method with an argument of `1`.
1. This would update the model by deleting the specified pool at the first index, then the result of the command execution `CommandResult` would be created and returned back to `LogicManager`.

### findPool feature
This feature allows users to find a pool that contains a passenger with a provided keyword in their name.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("findPool n/Alice")` command.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `findPool n/Alice` Command](images/FindPoolSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  The `command` argument that is passed into
`execute()`, represents the string `"findPool n/Alice"`, and has been abstracted for readability.
<br>
The lifeline for `FindPoolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"findPool n/Alice"` command.
1. `AddressBookParser` class is then created, which subsequently creates `FindPoolCommandParser` class to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then have its `parse()` method invoked to parse the argument `"n/Alice"` and passes it to
   `FindPoolCommandParser`.
1. `FindPoolCommandParser` parses the argument `"n/Alice"` and creates a `PooledPassengerContainsKeywordPredicate` which is returned to the `FindPoolCommandParser`.
1. `FindPoolCommandParser` then creates a `FindPoolCommand`, and provides the newly created `PooledPassengerContainsKeywordPredicate` to it. The `FindPoolCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of the `FindPoolCommand`, which in turn calls the `updateFilteredPoolList()` method in `Model`, causing the shown pool list to be updated according to the predicate in the `FindPoolCommand` object.
1. A `Pool` object is then created with the list of passengers returned by `getPassengersFromIndexes()`, and then added to the model by the `addPool()` method.
1. Finally, a `CommandResult` would be returned to `LogicManager` to indicate the completion status of the command.

### Find feature

The rationale behind expanding on the find feature is to allow for the user to find passengers by more attributes to improve usability.
Instead of being restricted to searching for names only, the user can now find other passengers with the same day or of a certain area.
This is vital as it is necessary to improve the usability for the user when attempting to find passengers to carpool with drivers.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n/Lucy n/Adam` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  The `command` argument that is passed into
`execute()`, represents the string `"find n/Lucy n/Adam"`, and has been abstracted for readability.
<br>
The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the diagram illustrated above:
1. `LogicManager` has its `execute()` method called when a user enters the `"find n/Lucy n/Adam"` command.
1. Object of `AddressBookParser` class is then accessed, which then subsequently creates `FindCommandParser` class object to help parse the user's command.
1. `AddressBookParser` would then invoke the `parse()` method of `FindCommandParser`, with parameters `n/Lucy n/Adam`, to parse the arguments `n/Lucy n/Adam`.
1. `FindCommandParser` parses the arguments `n/Lucy n/Adam` and creates a `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` object named `predicate` which is returned to the `FindCommandParser` object.
1. `FindCommandParser` then instantiates a `FindCommand` object with `predicate` as a parameter. The `FindCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` would subsequently invoke the `execute()` method of `FindCommand`, which in turn calls the `updateFilteredPoolList()` method in `Model`, causing the shown pool list to be updated according to `predicate` in the `FindCommand` object.
1. A `CommandResult` object is then created with a message which includes the number of passengers found on the list updated by `updateFilteredPoolList()`.
1. Finally, the `CommandResult` object is returned to `LogicManager`.
