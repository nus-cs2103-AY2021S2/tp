## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-task 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-task 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-task 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` and `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the planner data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete-task 5` command to delete the 5th task in the address book. The `delete-task` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete-task 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-task`, just save the task being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Viewing list of tags

Each task may be associated with 0 or more tags that are stored in the `UniqueTagList`. The `UniqueTagList` ensures that
no 2 tags are duplicate in the program at 1 time, emphasizing the abstraction of tags as an Object.

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

The `UniqueTagList` then exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tag>` to be observed by the `UI`, much like how the
list of tasks is being observed by the `UI`. This tag list is presented visually using `TagListPanel` in `UI`. Below is
an activity diagram illustrating how a command will trigger a change in the `UniqueTagList`, in continuation from the
delete command activity diagram in the
[`Logic`](#logic-component) section:

![UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram](images/UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram.png)

The `UniqueTagList` class encapsulates the data and related behavior of a unique tag list, which removes the given tag
from its internal list in the diagram above. The `ModelManager` provides access to the list for the `UI` as shown
below:

![UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram2](images/UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram2.png)

As seen, there is a clear separation of responsibilities between the `UI`, `Logic` and `Model`, which complies with
the Observer pattern where the view in `UI` communicates with the `UniqueTagList` in `Model` through an
interface, subscribing to the changes in the list.
This interface is actually `<<Logic>>` and `<<Model>>`, implemented by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`, which are
abstracted out of the diagram for more concrete representation.

### Mark task as done

A task has a Status attribute which can be marked as done, using the Done command.

  * The Status attribute is a data field belonging to Task, and only has 2 valid values: 'done' and 'not done'.
  * The doneCommand only takes in a single parameter, INDEX, which must be a valid positive integer.

The following activity diagram illustrates how a user might utilise this feature:

![DoneCommandActivityDiagram](images/DoneCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram has been simplified to show the main processes called during the execution of
DoneCommand.

![DoneSequenceDiagram](images/DoneSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, the Done Command makes use of the setTask() function to update the model
since this process is equivalent to updating the status attribute from 'not done' to 'done'. This abides by the DRY
principle to avoid writing functions with similar logical processes.


### Find matching task using keyword(s)

The `find` command is applicable to **all tasks** within PlanIT. There are 3 different methods of `find` implementations:
1. Find by title : Find all matching task(s) using any matching full keyword(s) from title of task using `find [KEYWORDS]`
2. First by tag : Find all matching task(s) with exact matching full keyword(s) from tag(s) of task using `find t/[TAG]`
   Only this method can be used to search matching task(s) with full keyword(s) from multiple tags like `find t/ t/`
3. Find by description : Find all matching task(s) using any matching full keyword(s) from description of task using `find d/[DESCRIPTION]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** All 3 methods cannot be mixed with each other.</div>

Below is an activity diagram of the above 3 methods which illustrates the general process applicable for the 3 different find implementation queries.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

Below is also an example of the default method of find by title general process description followed by the sequence diagram illustration.

##### Find by title
1. After the `find` command is entered by the user, the input argument is passed to `LogicManager`.
2. The same argument will then be parsed into `PlannerParser`.
2. `FindCommandParser` will be generated when the command word `find` is detected by the `PlannerParser`.
3. `FindCommandParser` will then parses the keywords to `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
4. `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be generated and a predicate value will be returned to `FindCommandParser`.
5. `FindCommandParser` will send the predicate value to `FindCommand`.
6. `FindCommand` will be generated and returns the command to the `LogicManager`.
7. `FindCommand` will call `execute(model)` function and it will pass predicate value into the `Model` through `updateFilteredTaskList`.
8. `filteredTasks` list will be updated accordingly in `ModelManager` and the filtered list display in PlanIT will be updated.
9. `CommandResult` will eventually be returned to the `LogicManager` and feedback will be given to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**For find by tag and find by description,
the steps are similar except for step 3 and 4 where it will be TagContainsKeywordsPredicate and
DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate 
respectively in place of TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate </div>

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations
For the `find` command, there are 2 design choices being considered in whether to split the 3 implementation methods
like `findTag`,
`findTitle`, `findDescription`  into three different commands separately 
or just use a single command `find` in addition with command line prefix to perform 3 different implementations. 

1. **Current design**: Having a single command `find` to perform 3 different implementations.

    - Advantages:
        - From the user point of view, they do not have to remember extra commands since there are a lot of commands
          within PlanIT
          and it is quite intuitive to remember the command line prefix like `t/` `d/`since these prefix will be used for most commands in the PlanIT.
        - The problem of duplicate codes will be minimised since the general process from LogicManager -> PlannerParser 
          -> FindCommandParser -> FindCommand to Model and CommandResult are similar for the 3 different methods. The place where they differ
          is only from FindCommand Parser to TitleContainsKeyWordsPredicate, DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate and TagContainsKeywordsPredicate.

    - Disadvantages:
        - The code will be cluttered in a FindCommandParser for the 3 different implementation methods.

2. **Alternative design**: Having 3 different commands `findTag`, `findTitle`, `findDescription`
   to perform 3 different implementations.

    - Advantages:
        - Code will be segregated out and parser for each implementation will not be so complex.

    - Disadvantages:
        - There is a need to use 3 parser and 3 commands in code implementation which increase the likelihood of code
          duplication.
        - Since there are more commands for the user to remember, it is highly likely for the user to keep referring to the user guide 
          if the user keeps forgetting the various commands.


### Deleting a field from a task

A task in the planner's task list can contain multiple fields. Some of these fields can be deleted without deleting
the entire task, while other fields are compulsory and cannot be deleted. 
- Deletable fields: `Deadline`, `RecurringSchedule`, `Description`, `Tag`, `Duration`
- Non-deletable fields: `Title`, `Status` 

An example of how a user might use this command is shown in the activity diagram below.

![DeleteFieldActivityDiagram](images/DeleteFieldActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete field command works internally.

![DeleteFieldSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteFieldSequenceDiagram.png)

Alternatives: 
1) Delete field by setting it to an empty string. (Current choice) 
This approach was chosen as it is easy to implement, and not too much of refactoring of code is needed.
   
2) Delete field by setting it to null.
    
    This approach was not chosen as it would require more refactoring of code - if anything is missed out,
    it will result in undesirable runtime exceptions.
