## **Introduction**
**Tutor Tracker** is a desktop tuition management application meant for secondary students to track their tuition information, such as upcoming tuition appointments and tutor's contact information.
It focuses on the Command Line Interface (CLI) while providing users with a simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Thus, the main interaction with **Tutor Tracker** will be done through commands.

Tutor Tracker is an all-in-one tuition management solution for tech-savvy secondary school students.
The features of Tutor Tracker includes:

- Viewing of tutors' profile
- Adding new tuition appointments
- Filtering tutors by personal preference (i.e. availability, experiences, name, location, price, etc.)
- Viewing upcoming tuition appointments

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to help you understand the design and implementation of Tutor Tracker to get started on your contributions to Tutor Tracker.

## **Design**
This section will help you learn more about the design and structure of Tutor Tracker. Each section will describe and explains how each component of the application works.
It's noteworthy to mention that the Tutor Tracker follows an Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.


### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

_Figure 1. Architecture Diagram of Tutor Tracker_


The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

The application consists of 6 main components:

| Component                           | Description
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Main`                              | **`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). <br/>It is responsible for: <li>At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.</li> <li>At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.</li>|
| [**`UI`**](#ui-component)           | The UI of the App.                                                   |
| [**`Logic`**](#logic-component)     | The command executor.                                                |
| [**`Model`**](#model-component)     | Holds the data of the App in memory.                                 |
| [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) | Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.                  |
| [**`Commons`**](#common-classes)    | Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.|

For each of `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` component, it
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_appointment 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TutorTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an appointment).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_appointment 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete appointment_1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : `Model.java`

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the TutorTracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : `Storage.java`

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Tutor Tracker details in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.TutorTracker.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### [Proposed] Favourite Feature
####Proposed Implementation
The proposed favourite feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her favourites.
out of the entire list of tutors. It implements the following operations:
* `Favourite tutor` - Add a tutor to the list of favourite tutors.
* `Unfavourite tutor` - Delete the tutor from the list of favourite.
* `List favourites` - Show the list of the favourite tutor.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `FavouriteCommand`,
`UnfavouriteCommand` and `ListFavouriteCommand`.

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the favourite feature behaves at each step.

### [Proposed] Note Feature
####Proposed Implementation
The proposed note feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her own notes of different
tutors and appointments. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `Add note` - Add a note
* `Delete note` - Delete a note
* `Edit note` - Edit a note

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the note feature behaves at each step.

### [Proposed] Gradebook Feature
####Proposed Implementation
The proposed gradebook feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her
own grades of different subjects for reference, which are internally stored as `gradeList`. Additionally,
it implements the following operations:
* `Add a subject grade` - Add a subject grade to user's gradebook
* `Delete a subject grade` - Delete a subject grade by subject name
* `Edit a subject grade` - Edit a subject grade by subject name

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddGradeCommand`,
`DeleteGradeCommand` and `EditGradeCommand`.

Given below is example usage scenarios and how the gradebook features behave.

### [Proposed] Filter Feature
This Filter feature would allow users to manage filters and apply them to the list of tutors
and appointments. This would facilitate filtering of tutors by attributes such as personal
information as well as the subjects they teach, as well as filter appointments by appointment attributes.

The following commands would be added:
* Add filter - Add a new filter to the filter list, updating the visible tutors and appointments
* Delete filter - Delete a filter from the filter list
* Edit filter - Edit a filter from the filter list (including whether it is active)
* List filters - List all filters currently used

#### Proposed Implementation
A new `Filter` class would be implemented, along with a list to store them. Each `Filter` object
would contain predicates that filter the attribute classes, which would be combined and used to
filter the lists of tutors and appointments.

These filters would be shown in the UI along the top of the list of tutors and appointments, showing
the active and inactive filters.

### [Proposed] Schedule Feature
####Proposed Implementation
The proposed schedule feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her
own schedule, which are events that are closely related to tuition, i.e., tuition's homework deadline.
The schedules are internally stored in `scheduleList`.
Additionally,  it implements the following operations:
* `Add a schedule` - Add a schedule to the user's schedules
* `Delete a schedule` - Delete a schedule by schedule name
* `Edit a schedule` - Edit a schedule by schedule name

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddScheduleCommand`,
`DeleteScheduleCommand` and `EditScheduleCommand`.

Given below is example usage scenarios and how the schedule features behave.

### [Proposed] Reminder Feature
####Proposed Implementation
The proposed reminder feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her
own events (`appointment` or `schedule`) in the form of reminders when he/she runs the application.
The reminders are internally stored in `reminderList`.
Additionally,  it implements the following operations:
* `Add a reminder` - Add a reminder to the user's reminders
* `Delete a reminder` - Delete a reminder by index
* `Edit a reminder` - Edit a reminder by index

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddReminderCommand`,
`DeleteReminderCommand` and `EditReminderCommand`.

### [Proposed Budget Feature]
#### Proposed Implementaion
The proposed budget feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of the total
cost of all of his own appointments and whether it is within the budget he has set for
himself. The budget is an optional feature, and can easily be added through
CLI.
It supports the following operations:
#### `command` - example usage
* `add_budget budget_size` - add_budget b/500
* `edit_budget budget_size` - edit_budget b/600
* `delete_budget` - delete_budget
* `view_budget` - view_budget


Given below is example usage scenarios and how the reminder features behave.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Tech-savvy secondary school students in Singapore who to need to search for tutors and manage their tuition appointments, and prefer CLI over GUI.

**Value proposition**:

The demand for tuition in Singapore is escalating, especially among secondary school students. A large amount of time and money has been invested in finding tutors and managing ever growing lists of tuition appointments. Currently, there are limited number of apps and websites that cater to this need, particularly in a streamlined typing oriented CLI. Therefore, this app aims to assist secondary school students in streamlining the process of searching for tutors and managing their tuition appointments. These students can search for an ideal tutor based on their personal preferences (such as subjects, expertise, years of experience, cost, availability etc.), and cut down on the time taken tracking their favoured tutors and tuition appointments.
