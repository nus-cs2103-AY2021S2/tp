## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Target User Profile**

The target user profile are dog school managers that own and manage the daily operations of the dog schools. They 
handle a wide range of operations such as keeping track of the dogs under their care, arranging classes and taking care 
of the dogs on a daily basis. They need a systematic way of maintaining their handle on the operations of their school 
at all times.

## **Value Proposition**

In Singapore, dog schools are popular among dog owners. Besides day care, they also provide training,
grooming and workshops. With many moving parts daily, managing operations  can get overwhelming.
PawBook is an all-in-one management system to help dog school managers keep track of attendance, scheduling and services
and maintain organisation. At present, there is no such application to help dog school owners to organise and
manage their dog school currently. This application serves to increase the effectiveness and efficacy of dog schools
which in turn allows dog schools and its owners to take in more dogs. This application is necessary to help organise the
school's system. By increasing the intake of dogs in dog schools, this increases the number of trained dogs in Singapore
in general which solves the general problem of untrained dogs in Singapore being a nuisance to the public.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PawbookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a owner).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete owner 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete owner 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Entity` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Entity` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `pawbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding/deleting feature

#### What it is

Pawbook manages more than one type of entity, each with their own unique attributes. An OOP approach is used here whereby both the `AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand` are generic classes that extends the `Command` class. This way any number of other classes extending `Entity` can be added/deleted as well.
Example: `add owner n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]..`

#### Implementation

The actual execution of these commands are largely the same and can be easily reimplemented to include more verification to the data if necessary, e.g. verifying that the owner ID refers to an actual owner instead of taking in an arbitrary number.

In order to generate the respective commands, the raw input needs to be parsed first. It is required that the user provide a second keyword right after the `add`/`delete` command keyword to indicate the correct entity type to be added. Using this information, the arguments can be forwarded to the correct parser from within `PawbookParser` to be further processed. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `add owner n/BRUCE p/92019201 e/bruce@example.com a/BLK 123 Adam Road t/friendly` to save an owner.

Step 2. The owner  is added to the model.

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid add command from the user.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid delete command from the user.

![DeleteActivityDiagram](diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.puml)
### Edit feature
Pawbook allows the user to `edit` an entity. For instance, the user may want to `edit`  some features of an owner. By entering the edit command with the correct identification number of the owner to be edited, the specified features of the owner will be modified accordingly.

In order to generate the respective commands, the raw input needs to be parsed first. It is required that the user provide a second keyword right after the `edit` command keyword to indicate the correct entity type to be edited. Using this information, the arguments can be forwarded to the correct parser from within `PawbookParser` to be further processed.

Below is an example activitiy diagram for a valid view command from the user.

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

### Find feature 
Pawbook allows the users to `find` an entity based on keyword searches. The `find` function entertains multiple keyword 
searches and reveals the entire list of commands that match one or more of the results. 

When the user enters a valid command with the keyword searches, the arguments are parsed by the `FindCommmandParser` that 
converts the string of arguments into a list, that is subsequently passed on to a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance 
that uses the list of keywords to find the search results based on the supplied keywords. 

This predicate is passed into the `ModelManager`'s `updateFilteredEntityList()` method and subsequently generates the 
CommandResult instance that is then passed on in the LogicManager. 

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

### View feature 
Pawbook allows the user to `view` an entity and all its related entities. For instance, the user may want to `view` all the dogs of one particular owner or all the dogs enrolled in a program. By entering the correct view command with the correct identification number, the entire list will be generated. 

When the user enters a valid command with the target entity ID, the ViewCommandParser will firstly parse the command and store the ID as an integer that is then passed on to as a parameter into the constructor method of a new ViewCommand instance.

Subsequently, once the new `ViewCommand` instance has been created, in its execute method, it will retrieve the entity via the ID that was passed in, from the `ModelManager`. With a handle on the target entity now, we build a list consisting of the entity IDs that are to be shown as search results. 

Based on the class type of the target entity, we will reveal the search results accordingly. If the target entity is a `Dog`, then we will show the relevant owner profile. If the target entity is a `Owner`, then we will list out all of the owner's dogs. Similar to owner, for `Program`, we will reveal the full list of dogs enrolled in that program. 

This list is subsequently passed on to the `RelatedEntityPredicate` that will later be used in the ModelManager's `updatefilteredEntityList())` method to finally reveal the search results.


Below is an example activitiy diagram for a valid view command from the user. 

![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

### Drop feature
While Pawbook allows the enrolling of dogs into programs, conversely it supports dropping previously-enrolled dogs from the programs.

To drop a dog from a program, the raw input is parsed and goes through several checks to ensure that the provided dog and program IDs are both valid and are indeed referring to dog and program objects respectively. Subsequently, the arguments will be forwarded to `DropCommandParser` followed by `PawbookParser` where they are converted from the String input to int.

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid drop command from the user.

![DropActivityDiagram](images/DropActivityDiagram.png)

#### Alternate implementations

### Enrol feature
Pawbook supports the enrolling of specific dogs into specific programs. 

In order to enrol a dog into a program, the raw input needs to be parsed first. It is required that the user provides 2 parameters, namely `dogId` and `programId`. These inputs have the prefix `/d` and `/p`, and is followed by an integer. Using this information, the arguments will be forwarded to the `EnrolCommandParser` from within `PawbookParser`, which converts the String input to int. 

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid enrol command from the user.

![EnrolActivityDiagram](images/EnrolActivityDiagram.png)

### Alternate implementations
As dogs and programs can also be identified by their respective names instead of IDs, another implementation could be replacing the parameters of `dogId` and `programId` with their respective names.

However, this requires there to be no duplicate dog or program names.
 
### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th owner in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new owner. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the owner was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the owner being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
