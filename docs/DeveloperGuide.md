## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `BookingSystemParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the booking system data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `BookingSystem`, which `Person` references. This allows `BookingSystem` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/booking/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the booking system data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.booking.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBookingSystem`. It extends `BookingSystem` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `bookingSystemStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBookingSystem#commit()` — Saves the current booking system state in its history.
* `VersionedBookingSystem#undo()` — Restores the previous booking system state from its history.
* `VersionedBookingSystem#redo()` — Restores a previously undone booking system state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitBookingSystem()`, `Model#undoBookingSystem()` and `Model#redoBookingSystem()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookingSystem` will be initialized with the initial booking system state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single booking system state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the booking system. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitBookingSystem()`, causing the modified state of the booking system after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `bookingSystemStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted booking system state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitBookingSystem()`, causing another modified booking system state to be saved into the `bookingSystemStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitBookingSystem()`, so the booking system state will not be saved into the `bookingSystemStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBookingSystem()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous booking system state, and restores the booking system to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial BookingSystem state, then there are no previous BookingSystem states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoBookingSystem()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoBookingSystem()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the booking system to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `bookingSystemStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest booking system state, then there are no undone BookingSystem states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoBookingSystem()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the booking system, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitBookingSystem()`, `Model#undoBookingSystem()` or `Model#redoBookingSystem()`. Thus, the `bookingSystemStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitBookingSystem()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `bookingSystemStateList`, all booking system states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire booking system.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Creating a venue
1. Adding Victoria Hall
    1. Prerequisites: a venue by the same name cannot already exist. If it is present as a record in the system, delete it.

    2. Test case: `create_venue v/Victoria Hall`<br>
    Expected: Victoria Hall should appear in the list of venues. The default capacity should be set to 10 as it was unspecified in the command, and there should be no description.

    3. Test case: `create_venue v/Victoria Hall max/50`<br>
    Expected: Victoria Hall should appear in the list of venues with a capacity indicated to be 50. No description should be present.

    4. Test case: `create_venue v/Victoria Hall d/Popular concert hall`<br>
    Expected: Victoria Hall should appear in the list of venues with a description "Popular concert hall". Capacity should be set to a default of 10.

### Creating a person
1. Adding a person record for John Doe
    1. Prerequisites: a person by the same name cannot already exist. If it is present as a record in the system, delete it.

    2. Test case: `add n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com `<br>
    Expected: There should be an error stating that the the booking command is invalid. This is due to a missing phone number.

    3. Test case: `add n/John Doe p/98765432`<br>
    Expected: There should be an error stating that the the booking command is invalid. This is due to a missing email.
