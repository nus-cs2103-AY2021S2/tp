## **Design**

### Architecture

![Application Architecture](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-patient 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The component specifics are elaborated in the following sections.

![Class Diagram of Appointment](images/AppointmentDiagram.png)

The ***Appointment Diagram*** given above explains the interactions between the fundamental classes of the App: `Appointment`, `Patient` and `Doctor`.
* `Patient` and `Doctor` are extensions of the `Person` abstract class which defines the criterion for duplicate identities.
* `PatientMap` and `DoctorMap` maintain unique records of patients and doctors respectively via the assignment of `UUID`.
* `Appointment` stores the `UUID` and accesses `Patient` and `Doctor` data through `DoctorMap` and `PatientMap` respectively.
* Conflicts between appointments are then defined by duplicate persons bounded by overlapping `Timeslot`.

This interaction between the 3 classes maintain the integrity of the App's appointment schedule, patient records and doctor records.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

![Structure of the DisplayPanels and DisplayCards](images/UiDisplayPanelsCardsDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,`PatientListPanel`, `DoctorListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.




The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data and appointment schedule data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in these lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Person`,

* stores a `Person` class, which the `Doctor` class and `Patient` class inherit from.

The `Appointment`,

* stores a `Appointment` class, which access `Patient` object and `Doctor` object via the `PatientMap` class and `DoctorMap` class.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) Person model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. Similar design can be applied to the Appointment model.<br>

![BetterAppointmentModelClassDiagram](images/BetterAppointmentModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
App-Ointment is intended for Receptionists of Medical Clinics who help schedule appointments, and maintain patient records and accounts.

* has a need to manage a significant number of scheduled appointments
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps


**Value proposition**

- Allows users to track and reschedule appointments for a clinic, reducing no-shows.
- Allow users to verify the patient on arriving at the clinic for the appointment.
- No cross clinic support for clinics within a health group.
- No support for users who want to view their own appointments.

    * **2b1.** App-Ointment warns user about the conflicting appointment.<br>
    * **2b2.** App-Ointment suggest user to either change the other existing appointment details through a separate `edit-appt` command, before editing the current appointment again, or change the edit details of the current appointment.<br>
    Use case ends.

### UC19: Find appointments by search fields 
**MSS** 
1. User enters the `find-appt` command and corresponding subcommands. 
2. App-Ointment changes the displayed list of appointments to fit. 

**Extensions** 
* **1a.** System detects an invalid subcommand format. 
    * **1a1.** App-Ointment prompts user that syntax is incorrect and displays the expected format.<br> 
    Steps 1a1 is repeated until the subcommand entered is correct/free from errors. 
    Use case resumes from step 2. 

* **2a.** There are no appointments to display. 
    * **2a1.** App-Ointment informs user that there are no appointments to display.<br> 
    Use case ends. 

### UC20: List all appointments
**MSS**
1. User enters the `list-appt` command.
2. App-Ointment displays all appointments in the appointment schedule.

### Non-Functional Requirements
_Non-functional requirements specify the constraints under which App-Ointment is developed and operated._

#### Constraints:
* The system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system.

#### Technical requirements:
* Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.

#### Performance requirements:
* Should be able to hold up to 1000 patients without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
* Should be able to hold up to 1000 doctors without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
* Should be able to hold up to 1000 appointments without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

#### Quality requirements:
* A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

#### Notes about project scope:
* The App-Ointment data file is private and local to the user.
