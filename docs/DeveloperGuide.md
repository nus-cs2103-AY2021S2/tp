## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete property 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to the limitation of PlantUML, some triangles that are used to indicate class inheritance and some solid diamonds that are used to denote composition may overlap with each other.
</div>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PropertyListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PocketEstateParser` class to parse the user's input command.
1. Depending on the command string passed in by the user,
   * a specific command parser (e.g. `AddPropertyCommandParser`) may be created to parse the input arguments to produce the corresponding `Command` object, or
   * the `Command` object can be directly created for some commands (e.g. `HelpCommand`).
1. The `Command` object is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a property, deleting a property).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object, which is passed back to the `Ui`. The feedback to the user is then displayed to the user.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add property n/Mayfair t/Condo a/1 Jurong East Street 32, #08-111 p/609477 d/31-12-2021")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add property n/Mayfair t/Condo a/1 Jurong East Street 32, #08-111 p/609477 d/31-12-2021` Command](images/AddPropertySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddPropertyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to the limitation of PlantUML, some multiplicities and association roles may be slightly out of place.
</div>

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences, such as
  * the preferred GUI settings (e.g. window size of the app)
  * the preferred storage filepath for the property book
  * the preferred storage filepath for the appointment book
* stores the property book and appointment book data
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Property>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change
* does not depend on any of the other three components


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPrefs` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the appointment book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the property book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Property component

![Structure of the Property Component](images/PropertyClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to the limitation of PlantUML, some solid diamonds that are used to denote composition may overlap with each other.
</div>

#### Implementation

A `Property` is stored in a `UniquePropertyList`, which ensures that there are no duplicate properties in the `PropertyBook`. Each `Property` is uniquely identified by its `Address` and `PostalCode`.

A `Property consists of the following mandatory attributes,
  * a `Name`: the name of the property
  * a `Type`: the housing type of the property (Hdb, Condo, Landed)
  * an `Address`: the address of the property
  * a `PostalCode`: the postal code of the property
  * a `Deadline`: the property's deadline for selling
  * a `Tag` set: a set of zero or more `Tag` objects

and the following optional attributes,
  * a `Remark`: a note about the property
  * a `Status`: represents the current stage of the selling (Option, Sales Agreement, Completion)
  * a `Client`: represents the seller of the property

A `Client` consists of at least one of the following attributes,
  * a `Name`: the name of the client
  * a `Contact`: the contact number of the client
  * an `Email`: the email of the client
  * an `AskingPrice`: the asking price of the client

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: How each attribute of `Property` is stored

* **Current implementation:** Each attribute of `Property` is immutable. When a property is to be edited, a new `Property` containing the updated fields will be created to replace the original `Property` object.
    * Pros: Prevent accidental modification of a `Property` object (less prone to bugs)
    * Cons: More code to be written as a separate `Property` object has to be created for each edit operation

* **Alternative:** Allow mutable `Property` objects (provide setter methods to update the attributes of a `Property`)
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: More prone to bugs

### Appointment component

![Structure of the Appointment Component](images/AppointmentClassDiagram.png)

#### Implementation

An `Appointment` is stored in a `UniqueAppointmentList`, which ensures that there are no duplicate appointments in the `AppointmentBook`. Each `Appointment` is uniquely identified by its `Date` and `Time`.

An `Appointment` consists of the following mandatory attributes,
* a `Name`: the name of the appointment
* a `Remark`: a note about the appointment
* a `Date`: the date of the appointment
* a `Time`: the time of the appointment

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: How each attribute of `Appointment` is stored

Similar design considerations as [how each attribute of `Property` is stored](#aspect-how-each-attribute-of-property-is-stored)

### \[Proposed\] Undo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo mechanism is facilitated by `PocketEstate`. It implements the undo feature with an undo history, stored internally as an `previousAppointmentLists` and `previousPropertyLists`. It implements

* `AppointmentBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous appointment book state from its history.
* `PropertyBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous property book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#undoAppointmentBook()` and `Model#undoPropertyBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PocketEstate` will be initialized with the initial appointment book state and property book state, and the currentAppointmentBookStatePointer currentPropertyBookStatePointer pointing to the two initial book states respectively.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete appointment 1` command to delete the 1st appointment in the appointment book. The `delete appointment` executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`, causing the previous state of the appointment book before the `delete appointment 1` command executes to be saved in the `previousAppointmentLists`, and the currentAppointmentBookStatePointer still points to the current appointment book state.

![UndoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add appointment â€¦â€‹` to add a new appointment. The `add appointment` command also executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`, causing a copy of the current appointment book state to be saved into the `previousAppointmentLists`.

![UndoState2](images/UndoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`, so the appointment book state will not be saved into the `previousAppointmentLists`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the appointment was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAppointmentBook()`, which will shift the `currentAppointmentBookStatePointer` to the most recently saved state, pointing it to the previous appointment book state, and restores the appointment book to that state.

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `previousAppointmentLists` is empty, then there are no previous AppointmentBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `commandHistory.empty()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the appointment book, such as `list`, will usually not executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`. Thus, the `previousAppointmentLists` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire appointment/property book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Saves the entire appointment/property list in the appointment/property book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 3:** Saves only changes made by previous commands (Similar to commit and restore in version control).
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, may only save the appointment/property being deleted, and the deleted appointment/property is added back if the command is undone).
  * Cons: Difficult to implement, different implementations are required to restore different changes.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Implemented\] Update feature

#### Implementation

The update mechanism is facilitated by `PocketEstate`. It implements the update feature with 3 parts, the `Status` field in `Property`, a `UpdateCommandParser` and `UpdateCommand`.

The `Status` field consists of a `Status` interface with a `next()` method that returns a `Status` representing the next stage of the property selling process. There are 3 classes that implement `Status`, `Option`, `SalesAgreement` and `Completion`. Each class takes in an `Offer` which represents the price that was offered for the property.

* `Option`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the stage where the buyer exercises the Option to Purchase.
* `SalesAgreement`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the stage where the buyer is considering the Sales and Purchase Agreement.
* `Completion`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the stage where the property has been sold.

![StatusClassDiagram](images/StatusClassDiagram.png)

The `UpdateCommand` is assisted by 3 subcommands that extend the abstract class `UpdateCommand` which itself extends `Command`. The subcommands are, `UpdateNewCommand`, `UpdateProceedCommand` and `UpdateCancelCommand`. The subcommands help execute on the model when the user calls `u/new`, `u/proceed` or `u/cancel` respectively.

* `UpdateNewCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Takes in an `Index` and an Amount to create a new `Status` with the given Amount for the property at the given `Index`.
* `UpdateProceedCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Takes in an `Index` and moves the `Status` of the property at the given `Index` to the next `Status` if applicable.
* `UpdateNewCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Takes in an `Index` and removes the `Status` of the property at the given `Index` if applicable.

![UpdateCommandClassDiagram](images/UpdateCommandClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PocketEstate` will be initialized with the initial appointment book state and property book state.

![UpdateStep1Initial](images/UpdateStep1Initial.png)

Step 2. The user executes `update 1 u/new 600,000` command to add a new status with value 600,000 to the first property.

![UpdateStep2New](images/UpdateStep2New.png)

Step 3. The user executes `update 1 u/proceed` to move the `Status` of the first property to `SalesAgreement`.

![UpdateStep3Proceed](images/UpdateStep3Proceed.png)

Step 4. The user executes `update 1 u/proceed` to move the `Status` of the first property to `Completion`.

![UpdateStep4Proceed](images/UpdateStep4Proceed.png)

Step 5. The user then decides that having the `Completion` status on the first property was a mistake and executes the command `update 1 u/cancel`.
