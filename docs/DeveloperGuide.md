## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## **Design**
### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

>**Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plan/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plan/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

**`Commons`** represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* **`UI`**: The UI of the App.
* **`Logic`**: The command executor.
* **`Model`**: Holds the data of the App in memory.
* **`Storage`**: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Plan feature
![PlanObjectDiagram](images/AddPlanObjectDiagram.png)

The `addp` command makes use of the `Plan` class to add a plan to the user's list of plans. The user must provide a valid `Description` for the plan, otherwise they will be prompted to do so.

#### Constructor:`Plan#new(Description description, Set<tag> tags, List<Semester> semesters)`
Creates a `Plan` object using the plan's `description`, its relevant `tags` as well as a list of `semesters` to include.

![PlanConstructorSequenceDiagram](images/PlanConstructorSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Method:`Plan#toString()`
Builds a formatted string by appending the plan's description as well as all of its tags.
The `getDescription` method is used to obtain the Description in `String` format.
Each Tag's `toString()` method is called.

![PlanToStringSequenceDiagram](images/PlanToStringSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Overview: Add Plan command
The following presents a final overview of how the `addp command` is used:

![AddPlanArchitectureSequenceDiagram](images/AddPlanArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

Do note that the current implementation always creates a new `Plan` instance whenever the `addp command` is provided by the user, to ensure that users create a new plan.

### Add Module to Semester Feature
![ModuleConstructionDiagram](images/ModuleObjectDiagram.puml.png)

The addm command makes use of the Module class to add a module to the user's choice of plan and semester.
The user must provide a valid Plan Number, Semester Number and Module Code, otherwise they will be prompted to do so.
Here, if the user input the module with grade behind, model will note down the grade and use the grade to calculate user's CAP
Otherwise, the module will be mark as undone.

Constructor: Plan#new(String ModuleCode, String ModuleTitle, int MCs, <optional> String grade)
Creates a module object with the given module code, module title, MCs and grade if provided.

#### Overview: Add Plan command
The following presents a final overview of how the addm command is used:

![AddModuleArchitectureSequenceDiagram](images/AddModuleArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

### History feature
![HistoryObjectDiagram](images/HistoryObjectDiagram.png)

The `history command` makes use of the `History` class to format information about semesters prior to the users `current semester` in their `master plan`. As such, a precondition for the `history command` is that the user must have identified both a `master plan` and `current semester`, otherwise they will be prompted to do so.

![HistoryHashmapClassDiagram](images/HistoryHashmapClassDiagram.png)

The `History` class is a helper class that extends `HashMap` and implements two methods, a constructor and a `toString` method. The following explains the functionality that each method provides and how they are implemented:

#### Constructor:`History#new(Plan p, Semester current)`
Creates a `History` object (a subclass of `HashMap`) using information about semesters from the Plan `p` up until the `current` semester. The *keys* to the `HashMap` are the prior semesters each corresponding *value* is a List of modules that were done in that semester.

![HistoryConstructorSequenceDiagram](images/HistoryConstructorSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Method:`History#toString()`
![HistoryToStringSequenceDiagram](images/HistoryToStringSequenceDiagram.png)

Builds a formatted string by iterating over each of the semesters stored as keys in the HashMap according to their semester number and in ascending order.

Each semester's `toString()` method is called which internally calls each modules `toString()` method.

#### Overview: History command
The following presents a final overview of how the `history command` is used:

![HistoryArchitectureSequenceDiagram](images/HistoryArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

Do note that the current implementation always creates a new `History` instance whenever the `history command` is provided by the user, to ensure that users are presented with their most updated information.

### Validate feature
The `validate` command looks at all modules from the `master` plan, specifically all semesters from the first to `current`. Every other plan is then looked at the same way up to whatever semester that `current` is set to. For example, if `current` is set to semester 5, validate takes the first 5 semesters of modules from the master plan and compares it to every other plan. If the other plans have every module that was found in the master plan, it is valid.


#### Overview: Validate command
![ValidateArchitectureDiagram](images/ValidateArchitectureDiagram.png)

The `validate` command makes use of the `ModelManager` class which contains the necessary list of `plan` objects, which contains the relevant `semester` and `module` objects. After accessing the ValidateCommand logic component, if `master` and `current` is set, the `ModelManager` is accessed.

#### State Diagrams
![ValidateStateDiagram](images/ValidateStateDiagram.png)

The `validate` command does not create other objects. It initializes with a null `masterPlan` and `currentSemester`, and updates them in the `execute()` method, throwing exceptions if they have not yet been set. If set successfully, validation continues.

![ValidateModelManagerSequenceDiagram](images/ValidateModelManagerSequenceDiagram.png)

In the `ModelManager`, the `validate(masterPlan, currentSemester)` method references every other existing `Plan` from the base master plan. The method then sets whether or not they are valid.

##### [Proposed] Validating using History object

Currently, `validate` checks each plan up to their semesters for the taken modules. This is rather slow since it has to loop through the modules. This can be done much faster using the `HashTable` which is provided by the `History` object. Although not currently a necessary feature since only a single user uses the application, this is a rather simple optimization that should be implemented.

### Info feature

![InfoCommandExecute](images/InfoFeatureClassDiagram.png)

The `InfoCommandParser` reads the user input and creates a `InfoCommand` to execute with the any arguments found.
The `InfoCommand` makes use of the `JsonModule` class to retrieve module information stored in json format to
display relevant information to the user.

#### InfoCommandParser
#### Method:`parse(String args)`

![InfoCommandExecute](images/InfoCommandParserParse.png)

After `ModulePlannerParser` removes the command word from the user input, `InfoCommandParser`
extracts the module code if found and creates an `InfoCommand` object with the module code otherwise
an `InfoCommand` object with no module code.
The created `InfoCommand` object is returned to `Logic` object for execution.

#### InfoCommand
#### Method: `execute(Model model)`

![InfoCommandExecute](images/InfoCommandExecute.png)

`InfoCommand` object retrieves all module information from `Model` object stored in `JsonModule`
object. Based on what arguments the `InfoCommand` object is created with, it finds the relevant
`JsonModule` object and sets it for the `Model` object `foundModule` field. Lastly, the `currentCommand`
field is updated for the UI to show a single module information or all of them.
