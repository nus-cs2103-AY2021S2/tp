--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Design**

### 2.1 Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder.
 Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
 and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Sequence diagram of the logic Component](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow2.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 2.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `RemindMeParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete m/CS2103 a/1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete m/CS2103 a/1` Command](images/DeleteFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the RemindMe data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` `ObservableList<Module>` or `ObservableList<GeneralEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `RemindMe`, which `Person` references. This allows `RemindMe` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 2.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the RemindMe data in json format and read it back.
* CalendarStorage is accessed by UI component which is no indicated in the diagram.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
<br><br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Add feature

#### Implementation

The proposed add implementation is facilitated by `ModelManager`, which extends `Model`. `ModelManager` contains FilteredList of each entities:
* Persons
* Modules
* General Events

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step. Input: `add m/CS2103T`

**Step 1:** Your input is parsed into `RemindMeParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** Based on the command word of your input (i.e., `add`), an AddCommandParser will be used.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** In `AddCommandParser#parseCommand`, your input will be tokenized using `ArgumentTokenizer`. `ArgumentTokenizer` uses your input, then searches for the prefixes and returns the `ArgumentMultimap`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4**: Using the `ArgumentMultimap` checks the prefixes in your input and returns the respective `AddCommandParser`.

    Module: `m/`: `AddModuleCommandPaser`
    Person: `n/`: `AddPersonCommandParser`
    General Event: `g/`: `AddGeneralEventParser`  
    if it is an unknown prefix, `parseCommand` will throw a ParseException and returns a `AddMessageUsage`. Since the input is `m/`, `AddModuleCommandPaser` will be returned.

**Step 5**: In `AddModuleCommandPaser`, `AddModuleCommandPaser#parse` is called. Again `ArgumentMultimap` is created using `ArgumentTokenizer` but only with `Module` prefix: `m/`. The class diagram shows the Parser class diagram when passing your input into the appropriate `AddModuleCommand`.
<br>
<br>

![AddCommandParserClassDiagram](images/AddCommandParserClassDiagram.png)

<br>
<br>

**Step 6:** The `parse` method does a few checks:

* If there isn't the `PREFIX`: `m/` present, or the preamble of the `PREFIX` is not empty, or your search input after the `PREFIX` is whitespaces, then `parse` method will throw `ParseException` and returns a `AddMessageUsage` for `Module`.
* Else your inputs is used to create a `title` which is then used to create a `module`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** `AddModuleCommand` is executed:

* Using the `module` as an input, the `Model#hasModule` method checks if the given `module` is a duplicate or not. If it is, it will throw `CommandException` and return a `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MODULE`.
* Else, using the `module` as an input, the `Model#addModule` method is called, and adds the `module` to the `UniqueModuleList` in `RemindMe`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 8:** The `CommandResult` is logged in the `logger` and using `resultDisplay#setFeedacktoUser`, returning `resultDisplay`. Using `resultDisplay#setText` shows the `CommandResult` in the `GUI`.
<br>
<br>

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)


### 3.2 Find feature

#### Implementation

The proposed find implementation is facilitated by `ModelManager`, which extends `Model`. `ModelManager` contains FilteredList of each entities:
* Persons
* Modules
* General Events

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step. Input: `find m/CS2101`

**Step 1:** Your input is parsed into `RemindMeParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** Based on the command word of your input (i.e., `find`), a FindCommandParser will be used.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** In `FindCommandParser#parseCommand`, your input will be tokenized using `ArgumentTokenizer`. `ArgumentTokenizer` uses your input, then searches for the prefixes and returns the `ArgumentMultimap`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** Using the `ArgumentMultimap` checks the prefixes in your input and returns the respective `FindCommandParser`.

    Module: `m/`: `FindModuleCommandPaser`
    Person: `n/`: `FindPersonCommandParser`
    General Event: `g/`: `FindGeneralEventParser`  
    if it is an unknown prefix, `parseCommand` will throw a ParseException and returns a `FindMessageUsage`. Since the input is `m/`, `FindModuleCommandPaser` will be returned.

<br>

**Step 5:** In `FindModuleCommandPaser`, `FindModuleCommandPaser#parse` is called. Again `ArgumentMultimap` is created using `ArgumentTokenizer` but only with `Module` prefix: `m/`. The class diagram shows the Parser class diagram when passing your input into the appropriate `FindModuleCommand`.  
<br>
<br>

![FindCommandParserClassDiagram](images/FindCommandParserClassDiagram.png)
<br>

**Step 6:** The `parse` method does a few checks:

* If there isn't the `PREFIX`: `m/` present, or the preamble of the `PREFIX` is not empty, or your search input after the `PREFIX` is whitespaces, then `parse` method will throw `ParseException` and returns a `FindMessageUsage` for `Module`.
* Else your inputs is split into individual keywords, and contained as a `List of keywords`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** The keywords will be stored in `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` as a `predicate`, then stored in `FindModuleCommand`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 8:** `FindModuleCommand` is executed:
    
* Using the `predicate`, the `Model#updateFilteredModuleList` is called with `predicate` as input.
* Using the `FilteredList<Module>#setPredicate` returns the filtered list of modules with titles matching to any of the `keywords` as a `CommandResult`.
<br>

**Step 9:** The `CommandResult` is logged in the `logger` and using `resultDisplay#setFeedacktoUser`, returning `resultDisplay`. Using `resultDisplay#setText` shows the `CommandResult` in the `GUI`.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)  

### 3.3 Delete Assignment

#### Implementation
RemindMe is able to delete an existing `Assignment` in an existing `Module`

The diagram below shows the relationships between `DeleteAssignmentCommand` and `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser` under 
the `Logic` component and the relationship between `Module` and `Assignment` under the `Model` component.

<br>
<br>
The following example usage scenario describes how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

    Assuming RemindMe has a Module named CS2103. This Module contains a AssignmentList that stores
    a list of Assignmnets:
    
    [D] Assigment1 due on  01/01/2021 2359
    [X] Assignment2 due on 05/05/2022 2359
    [D] Assignment3 due on 25/03/1021 2359
    
**Step 1:** The user launches the RemindMe application, `LogicManager` and `RemindMeParser` will be initialized.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** The user executes `delete m/CS2103 a/3` to delete the assignment at `Index` 3 from the `AssignmentList` of
the `Module` CS2103. This invokes the method `LogicManager#execute(String)` which then invokes the 
`RemindMeParser#parseCommand(String)` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** RemindMeParser will parse the command word `delete` and will create a DeleteCommandParser. The 
DeleteCommandParser will tokenize the prefixes and will choose to create a deleteAssignmentCommandParser to parse
the `Title` CS2103 and `Index` 3.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** The `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser` will create a new `DeleteAssignmentCommand` with the `Title` CS203 and 
`Index` 3 and return it back to the LogicManager.
<br>
<br>

**Step 5:** The `DeleteAssignmentCommand` verifies whether the target `Module` exist in the `FilteredModuleList` 
and whether an assignment exists at `Index` 3. If either fails, `DeleteAssignmentCommand` will throw a CommandException.
If not, it will invoke the method `Module#deleteAssignment(Index)` which removes the assignment at `Index` 3 from the 
`AssignmentList`
<br>
<br>

**Step 6:** A `CommandResult` will be created with a successful message if the user inputs are valid
and returned to `LogicManager`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** Lastly, `LogicManager` saves the updated RemindMe.

The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:
![DeleteFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)  

The following activity diagram summarises the general workflow for the Delete Command:
![DeleteFeatureActivityDiagram](images/DeleteFeatureActivityDiagram.png)  


### 3.4 Edit Assignment

#### Implementation
RemindMe is capable of editing an existing `assignment`. 


Below is a class diagram to show the relationship between `EditAssignmentCommand and EditAssignmentCommandParser` under 
the `Logic` component and the relationship between `Module` and `Assignment` under the `Model` component.
<br>
<br>

![EditFeatureClassDiagram](images/EditFeatureClassDiagram.png)
<br>
<br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

     Assuming RemindMe already has a Module named CS2103 and an Assignment Tut1 with time 01/01/2021 2359 stored.

**Step 1:** The user launches the RemindMe application, `LogicManager` and `RemindMeParser` will be initialized.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** The user executes `edit m/CS2103 a/1 d/Tut2` to edit the description of the first assignment
in the CS2103 module. This invokes the method `LogicManager#execute(String)` which then invokes the
 `RemindedParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** RemindMeParser will then create `EditCommandParser` 
which detects the edit conditions and calls `EditAssignmentCommandParser` 
to parse inputs according to the format specified.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** The `EditAssignmentCommandParser` will create a new `EditAssignmentCommand` 
with the given module `CS2103` , the given index `1`, the description `Tut2` and a null 
date and return it back to `LogicManager`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 5:** `LogicManager` calls the `EditAssignmentCommand#execute(Model)` method 
which then verifies whether the target module and assignment exists and whether
 the edited content is valid, eg. same content.
<br>
<br>

**step 6:** The `Model` calls `RemindMe#editAssignment(Module, index, Description)` method which retrieves
the module to edit from the `UniqueModuleList` ,retrieves and update the assignment and place the
module back to the list.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** A `CommandResult` will be created with a successful message if the user inputs are valid
and returned to `LogicManager`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 8:** Lastly, `LogicManager` saves the updated RemindMe.

    Note: An EditAssignmentCommand can either change the description or date of an assignment, not both.
    

The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![EditFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/EditFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises the general workflow for the Edit Command:

![EditFeatureActivityDiagram](images/EditFeatureActivityDiagram.png)


### 3.5 Calendar feature

#### Implementation

![CalendarSequenceDiagram2](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram2.png)


**Given below is an example of how the calendar UI is created.**

**Step1:** `CalendarWindow` will be created at the start of the program.
<br>
<br>

**Step2:** `CalendarWindow` will then call itself `CalendarWindow#loadCalendar` to load the details into the calendar.
<br>
<br>

**Step3:** In the `loadCalendar` method,  to ensure that the details inside calendar are the latest, 
the method will then call `CalendarStorage#refreshStorage` to update the storage for the calendar.
<br>
<br>

**Step4:** In the `refreshStorage` method, calendar storage will be cleared first by calling `CalendarStorage#clear`
and then the details about events are retrieved from RemindMe model by calling `RemindMe#getFilteredPersonList`
, `RemindMe#getFilteredModuleList` and `RemindMe#getFilteredEventList`.
<br>
<br>

**Step5:** With calendar storage updated, the calendar will then store events to each respective day and then the calendar
will be ready to be displayed as a GUI. 
<br>
<br>

![CalendarSequenceDiagram1](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram1.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar mechanism behaves at each step.  Input: `calendar`.

**Step 1.** Your input is parsed into `RemindMeParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** Based on the command word of your input (i.e., `calendar`), a `CalendarCommand` will be created.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** `CalendarCommand` is executed, and that will set boolean `showCalendar` to be true, the boolean is then 
pushed to `MainWindow` to call `MainWindow#handleCalendar` to show the `CalendarWindow`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** `CalendarWindow` loaded by its fxml file and called `CalendarWindow#show` to show its shown 
as a pop-up window for you.
