## **Design** [In Progress]

### Architecture

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API**: `Ui.java`

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All
these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in
`MainWindow.fxml`.

The `UI` component:

* Executes users' commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Any changes in `Model` data, i.e. customers, cheeses or orders data, are reflected through the `Panels` and `Cards`
  sub-components.

The class diagram below shows in more detail the compositions of the `Panels` and `Cards` components as well as their
relationships with other classes.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram_CHIM.png">

**API**: `Logic.java`

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. by adding customers, orders or cheeses).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult`
object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform
certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component
for the `execute("deletecheese 1")` API call.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete Feature

#### Implementation

Deleting customers, orders and cheeses are implemented in `DeleteCustomerCommand`,
`DeleteOrderCommand` and `DeleteCheeseCommand` respectively. These commands extend
abstract class `DeleteCommand`, and they all implement the operations `execute()` and `equals()`.

Cascading of Delete commands has been implemented such that if a customer is deleted,
any orders they have placed are also deleted. Similarly, when an order is deleted,
any cheeses assigned to it are deleted.

An example usage scenario representing the cascading of delete commands is given below.

Step 1. The user launches CHIM which has been initialised with customers,
orders (both complete and incomplete), and cheeses.

Step 2. The user executes `deletecustomer p/87438807` to delete the customer with the
phone number `87438807`. The command calls `DeleteCustomerCommand.execute()`
which calls on `ModelManager.deleteCustomer()`.

Step 3. The `ModelManager` calls `AddressBook.deleteCustomer()` where CHIM will delete
the customer and iterate through the orders list to find any orders placed by this customer.
These orders are deleted by calling `AddressBook.deleteOrder()`.

Step 4. `AddressBook.deleteOrder()` will delete the order. If the order was completed,
it will iterate through the cheeses list to find any cheeses assigned to this order.
These cheeses are deleted by calling `AddressBook.deleteCheese()`.

Step 5. `AddressBook.deleteCheese()` will delete the cheese.

The following sequence diagram shows how the operation `deletecustomer p/87438807`
is carried out as detailed above.

<img src="images/DeleteCustomerSeqDiagram_CHIM.png">

#### Design consideration

* Cascading of Delete commands has been implemented with the assumption that when a customer
or order is deleted, all information related to that customer or order must also be removed from CHIM.
* The cascading of Delete commands is implemented only in one direction (Customer to Order to Cheese).
Deleting an order will not delete the customer who placed the order.
Furthermore, deleting a cheese which has been assigned to an order is not allowed.
This is to prevent any extra erroneous deletions.
* All `execute()` calls by `DeleteCustomerCommand`, `DeleteOrderCommand` and `DeleteCheeseCommand`
will call on `Model.AddressBook` which will handle the cascading of delete commands in one place.


### Automatic Toggling of UI List Panels

#### Implementation

The application's user-interface shows, at any one time, **only one** of the following three lists:

1. Customer List
2. Cheese List
3. Order List

The UI automatically toggles between the three lists with respect to the user's latest command. For example:

- After running the `ListCheeseCommand`, the UI switches to showing the cheese list.
- After running the `AddCustomerCommand`, the UI switches to showing the customer list.
- After running the `FindOrderCommand`, the UI switches to showing the order list.

To enable the toggling, `GuiSettings` (of the `commons` package) stores an enumerable property to control which list to
show.

When the user keys in a valid input:

1. The `Command` object corresponding to the input, when executed, updates the enum in `GuiSettings`; the enum records
   which list is to be shown. This is done through the `ModelManager`.
2. The `UI` component then checks the `GuiSettings` and renders the desired list.

To better illustrate the idea - take, for instance, when the user inputs `listcheeses` which executes the
`ListCheesesCommand`:

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Can type fast

**Value proposition**:
1. Specific properties of each cheese
2. Track order status of each cheese (either by batches or individually)
