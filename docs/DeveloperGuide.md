## **Introduction**

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to cover the multi-level design architecture of Dictionote, so that the
intended audience of this document can understand the relationship between components that make up Dictionote.

### Audience

This developer guide is for anyone who wants to understand the internal software architecture of Dictionote.
The following groups of people are the intended audience:
* Dictionote developers: anyone who wish to upgrade Dictionote to support more functions.
* CS2103/T students: students of CS2103/T who want to improve their efficiency and productivity in learning.

### Dictionote Overview

Dictionote is a desktop app for CS2103/T Students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Dictionote in general helps to organise content and
definitions from the CS2103/T textbook, provide Note-keeping functions to facilitate learning, and enhance the ability
for students to connect and learn together with their cohort mates.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the
[diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. 
Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) 
to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API 
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface 
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `NoteListPanel`, `NoteCard` etc. 
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files 
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, 
the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Use `Logic` component to update the UI with new settings.
* `DictionaryContentPanel` use` DictionaryListPanelConfig` to detect `DictionaryListPanel`display status
* Model Component can request for content change using `DictionaryContentConfig` and `NoteContentConfig`

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `DictionoteBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the data for `Dictionote`, including `ContactsList`, `NoteBook`, `DictionaryBook` and `DefinitionBook`.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>`,`ObservableList<Note>`,`ObservableList<Content>`,`ObservableList<Definition>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changed.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `ContactsList` stores the `Contact` of the user. A `Contact` consists of `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `FrequencyCounter`, and a custom `Tag` class.
The `NoteBook` stores the `Notes` of the user. A `Note` also has a `Tag` class. The `Dictionary` stores both the `Definition` and `Content` in the `Dictionote`. 
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ContactList` and `NoteBook`, which `Contact` and `Note` references, respectively. This allows `ContactList` and `NoteBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag` in each "Book", instead of each `Contact` and  `Note` needing their own `Tag` object, respectively.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/dictionote/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save instances of the following classses in JSON format and read it back:
    * `UserPref`.
    * `ContactsList`.
    * `NoteBook`.
    * `Dictionary`.
    * `DefinitionBook`.
* depends on a few classes in the `Model` component; however, such dependencies are not shown in the diagram for simplicity's sake.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.dictionote.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Contact features

#### Sending an email to a contact

##### Implementation

This feature is implemented as a command, `EmailCommand`, that extends `Command`. It is an index-dependent command, meaning that the user must provide an index number when typing the command as a reference to a specific contact on the contacts list. In addition, the command has an optional index number argument that refers to a note within the note book.

The index number was selected to refer to a particular contact. This is due to its character length being shorter in most cases than any other field of information in `Contact` objects, making it both simple and sufficient. Likewise, notes are referred to by their index numbers for the same reasons.

The `execute()` method attempts to open a new window of the user's operating system (OS) default mail client. This is done by navigating to a `mailto` link with the contact's email address added to the end. In case a note index number is provided, the contents of the note located at the specified index number will be copied to the messages's body field.

If the command is executed successfully, the target contact's frequency counter (see [*Sorting the contacts list by most-frequently contacted*](./DeveloperGuide.md#sorting-the-contacts-list-by-most-frequently-contacted) below) will be incremented by one.

As an example, consider running Dictionote on a Windows 10 machine with Microsoft Outlook as the OS default mail client:

* Assume that the current state of the application is as follows (note the exisiting contacts on the left-side of the application's window and the note on the right):

![ContactEmailFeatureInitState](images/ContactEmailFeatureInitState.png)

* After typing in `emailcontact 2 ni\1` and executing it, the result would be:

![ContactEmailFeatureExecute](images/ContactEmailFeatureExecute.png)

* A new window, belonging to Microsoft Outlook's `New Message` function, will pop up:

![ContactEmailFeatureOSClient](images/ContactEmailFeatureOSClient.png)

* Note that the email of the selected contact, Bob (referred to in the command by his index number), is automatically written in the `To...` field of the email's header information.
* Also note that the body of the message contains the contents of the first note on the list (that is, `QA stands for Quality Assurance`).

In case the user does not have a mail client software set as default in their OS, Dictionote will try to navigate to the `mailto` link through the user's default browser (i.e., the `mailto` link will be treated as an ordinary URL link).

##### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** make use of the OS mail client to facilitate email features.
    * Pros: Easy to implement; utilizes a pre-existing and standardized system for invoking mail clients.
    * Cons: Requires the user to have a mail client installed on their OS, which is then set to be the default mail client of the system.

* **Alternative 2:** implement basic email features directly into Dictionote.
    * Pros: Does not depened on the existence of external software in the OS.
    * Cons: Much harder to implement, as it requires the implementation of network-related functions to handle the connections to email servers.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Sorting the contacts list by most-frequently contacted

##### Implementation

This feature is implemented as a command, `MostFreqContact`, that extends `Command`. It can execute without arguments, and it ignores any of them if provided.

The `execute()` method attempts to sort all contacts stored within the contacts list in descending order based on each contact's **frequency counter**, which is an attribute holding a non-negative integer value that represents the number of attempts an email was sent to that contact. The sorting is handled by the `sorted` method of the `ObservableList` class, of which an instance stores the contacts.

As an example, consider running Dictionote as follows:

* Assume that the current state of the application is as follows (note the exisiting contacts on the left-side of the application's window):

![ContactMostFreqFeatureInitState](images/ContactMostFreqFeatureInitState.PNG)

* In addition, assume the successful execution of the following commands:
    * `emailcontact 3` three times.
    * `emailcontact 2` one time.
    * `emailcontact 1` two times.

* After typing in `mostfreqcontact` and executing it, the result would be:

![ContactMostFreqFeatureExecute](images/ContactMostFreqFeatureExecute.PNG)

* Note that the ordering of the contacts in the contacts list had changed, with Charlie (formerly with index number 3) being the first on the list, followed by Alice (formerly with index number 1) and finally Bob (formerly with index number 2).

##### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** add a new attribute to the `Contact` class in order to keep track of the number of attempts to send an email.
    * Pros: Preserves the functionality of the `Contact` class before the implementation of the new feature; minimal integration issues with other `Contact`-dependent classes and methods.
    * Cons: Requires the creation of a new class to represent this attribute; adds an extra attribute to the contacts list's JSON storage file, which might requires more space (although it may be minimal).

* **Alternative 2:** create a `HashTable` to store a mapping between the contacts and the number of attempts to send an email of which they were the recipients.
    * Pros: Zero modifications on the `Contact` class; `Contact` objects will not contain any attributes required by this feature.
    * Cons: Difficult to integrate with the other classes and methods related to `Contact` objects (e.g., deletion of a contact from the list must propagate to the `HashTable`).


### UI features
#### Opening and closing UI through command result
#####  Implementation

Dictionote has an interactive user interface that allows the user to open and close any panel through command.
Furthermore, when any command is executed, 
Dictionote should be able to change the user interface based on the command type/requirement.
All commands should be able to open and close its required UI panel. 
The user will also be able to open and close the UI via user command.
The feature is implemented using `CommandResult`, which is returned by all `Command` in the system.

`CommandResult` contain a `String` object call `feedbackToUser`, a `UiAction` enum call `uiAction`
and `UiActionOption` enum call `uiActionOption`. `feedbackToUser` will
be show on the `ResultDisplay` indicating the command feedback after execution.
`uiAction` indicate the action the command want the `UI` to take.
e.g `UiAction.OPEN`, `UiAction.CLOSE`, ... etc. `UiActionOption` is only applicable to some `UiAction`.
It indicate the specific option available for the `UiAction`.
e.g `UiActionOption.CONTACT` for `UiAction.OPEN` mean open contact panel.

The following is the sequence diagram for executing a command to open a panel.

![OpenCommandSequenceDiagram](images/OpenCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of the existing `CommandResult` class
    * Pros: Make use of the existing system and easy to implement
    * Cons: All command will have to decide on the response. (or use the default setting) (desire behaviour)
* Alternative 2: Make use of the `Model` component as an intermediary between Command and UI.
  The command will call a method available on the `Model` component to change the UI settings,
  the `UI` will listen to the setting on the `Model` component.
    * Pros: Only the class that requires to change the UI will be needed to call the method.
    * Cons: Increasing coupling.
    
    
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Command that manipulation UI settings

#####  Implementation

While all `Command` has the ability to open and close the UI. There are some UI settings that are more specific.
In this case, we don't want all commands to implement its behavior, so using `CommandResult` isn't ideal.
Since the `UI` component is already uses `GuiSettings` to store its settings when Dictionote close.
We can make use of the existing structure by making the `UI` component 
to actively listen for changes to the `GuiSettings`.
The features are implemented in all `toggledivider` and `setdividerposition` commands.

The command will change the `GuiSettings` located in `Model` componenet. 
When the `CommandResult` is returned to the `UI` component.
The `UI` component will check for changes in `GuiSettings` and update it Ui according.

The following is the sequence diagram for executing a command to set note divider position.

![OpenCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ToggleCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

In the sequence diagram, `executeUiAction(action,option)` is called.
This is to show that the command ensure that the user receives proper feedback when the divider position changes.
The command will open all panels that were affected by the divider position change.
If the affected panel remain closed, the user will not be able to notice the changes.
Note divider affect both `NoteListPanel` and `NoteContentPanel`, hence if its  is closed, they will be open. 
The execution of the command will make both `NoteListPanel` and `NoteContentPanel` visible,
and the note divider positions will be adjusted to the desired position

#### Design Consideration

* Alternative 1 Make use of the existing `CommandResult` class
    * Pros: Make use of the existing system and easy to implement
    * Cons: All command will have to decide on the response. (or use the default setting)
* **Alternative 2(current choice):**: Make use of the `Model` component as an intermediary between Command and UI.
  The command will call a method available on the `Model` component to change the UI settings, 
  the `UI` will listen to the setting on the `Model` component.
    * Pros: Only the class that requires to change the UI will be needed to call the method.
    * Cons: Increasing coupling.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Note Features

#### Converting a note into a .txt file

Dictionote provides a method for its users to convert a note into a text file that are easily editable in other softwares.

This feature is implemented as a command, `ConvertTxtNoteCommand`, that extends `Command`. It is an index-dependent command, meaning that the user must provide an index number when typing the command as a reference to a specific note on the note list.

The `execute()` method will calls a `ConvertTxtNote` function, which uses Java's `BufferedWriter` and `FileWriter` class to write remotely.

Here is the example of the command usage. Assume initially, the state of the application is shown below:

![ConvertNoteToTxtStart](images/ConvertNoteToTxtStart.png)

* After typing in `converttxt 1` and executing it, the result would be:

![ConvertNoteToTxtEnd](images/ConvertNoteToTxtEnd.png)

* The resulting text file can be seen in the `data` folder.

![ConvertNoteToTxtResult](images/ConvertNoteToTxtResult.png)

* Here is the resulting note.

![ConvertNoteToTxtContent](images/ConvertNoteToTxtContent.png)

#### Design Consideration

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** make use of the Java's `FileWriter` class to help us write files.
    * Pros: Easy to implement; utilizes a pre-existing and standardized system for file writing.
    * Cons: Need to modify code later for enhancement later.

* **Alternative 2:** make our customized note-to-text converter class.
    * Pros: Enable us to convert more than text files and have specific usage for our code.
    * Cons: Very hard to implement, not enough time and knowledge.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Merge two notes into one

Dictionote provides a method for its users to merge two notes into one combined note.

This feature is implemented as a command, `MergeNoteCommand`, that extends `Command`. It is an index-dependent command, meaning that the user must provide 2 indexes number when typing the command as a reference to the notes that would like to be merged.

The `execute()` method will calls a `mergeNote` function which would delete both notes from NoteBook and add a new combined note into the NoteBook.

Here is the example of the command usage. Assume initially, the state of the application is shown below:

![ConvertNoteToTxtEnd](images/MergeNoteBefore.png)

After typing in `mergenote 1 2` and executing it, the result would be:

![ConvertNoteToTxtEnd](images/MergeNoteAfter.png)

#### Design Consideration

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement MergeNoteCommand which extends Command.
    * Pros: Easy to implement; match the design pattern already inherited from AB3.
    * Cons: More lines of code.

* **Alternative 2:** Make MergeNoteCommand as a function from the model immediately.
    * Pros: Less Lines of Code and simpler due to not extending the Command class.
    * Cons: Might be confusing as some of the commands are already implented and might not be consistent with other commands.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Dictionary features

#### Copying Content to a Note

#####  Implementation

Dictionote provides a way for users to copy over the content from the dictionary to a note.
This feature is implemented as a command, `copytonote`, combining 2 models, namely the 'Content', and the 'Note' Models.  

The `execute()` method will first call on `getFilteredCurrentDictionaryList()` to get the currently shown list in the dictionary panel.   
The method will then get the index keyed in by the user and find the corresponding content from the list at the index.   
A `String` object will then be created to store this information by getting the content body of the Content using the `get()` method.  
The nextstep is to produce a new note by calling the `new Note()` constructor, with the note content being the `String` object created by the `get()` method.   
Finally, the method will call on `addNote()` to add the created note into the notes list.  
The `execute()` method will facilitate the display of the new note in the note list panel.

The following is the sequence diagram for executing the `execute()` command in copying a content to a note.

![CopyToNote](images/CopyToNoteDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Consideration

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of the existing `Note` and `Content` models.
    * Pros: Make use of the existing system and easy to implement
    * Cons: Different methods and constructors have to be called since there exists 2 different models, which can induce type casting conflicts or get confusing. 
* Alternative 2: Create a new model that will contain a mix of the `Note` and `Content` models.
    * Pros: No constructors have to called and there won't be a need to worry about type casting failures.
    * Cons: Increasing workload and no other features will use this new model.
