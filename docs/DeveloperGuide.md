## **Description**

The Food Diary is a **desktop app for managing food diary entries**, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The Food Diary **caters to food-passionate NUS students** who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

The Food Diary will **allow students to save time and effort** when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity. The Food Diary especially caters to students chiefly on 3 aspects:
1. The ability for users to log personal food reviews tagged under different categories for future reference;
1. The ability to effortlessly reference food options based on relevant filters in a user-friendly GUI; and
1. The ability to import and export their personal food diary to share with friends.

## **Implementation**
### View Feature
#### Implementation
The View feature allows the user to view a specified entry in a new window, allowing the user to carefully look through
all the details of an entry. 

The mechanism works in such a way where after the user enters a command in the UI, the command will be passed into 
`MainWindow#executeCommand()`, in which `Logic#execute()` will be called to parse the user input in 
`FoodDiaryParser#parseCommand()`. The user input will be parsed as a 'View' command and executed to retrieve all the 
details related to the specified entry. The result of this execution will be passed back to the UI and shown in a 
pop up window.

The following sequence diagram shows how the View feature works:

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the constraints under which the system for The Food Diary is developed and operated.
The Food Diary system is made up of the front-end, which is interchangeably referred to as the User Interface (UI),
and the back-end, which handles data management and operations.

#### Technical requirements:

* The system should be operable on Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems, with Java 11 or above installed.

#### Performance requirements:

* The system should be loaded up within 2 seconds or less.
* The UI should appear within 2 seconds or less and be responsive to User input.
* The back-end should be responsive to processing User input at the same time the UI appears.
* The back-end should be able to handle 1,000 or more data entries (Food Diary entries) without noticeable sluggishness
  in performance for typical usage.

#### Usability requirements:

* The user should have access to a keyboard, and be proficient with typing alphanumeric English characters for commands
  to accomplish most of the usages of The Food Diary.

#### Project scope:
* The system should mainly comprise the handling of Food Diary-entry addition, deletion, and listing.
* The system would not be responsible for features involving multiple users

#### Scalability requirements:
* The system can handle a larger user base with many more food reviews being added to it
* Program is extendable for future addition of features easily

#### Other Noteworthy Points:

* The system should preserve data keyed in by the user

### Glossary
The glossary serves to ensure that all stakeholders, including users, have a common understanding of the noteworthy terms, and abbreviations.

* **Sluggishness**: The system starts to be slow in displaying user input when typed, and processing user input when entered.
