### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Car salesperson working in a multi-brand dealership
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

* Manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

* Offers a higher success rate of closing deals as car salesperson can focus on selling cars that fits <br>
  the customer needs and requirements

* Notify potential clients on promotions and new car launches based on their profile preferences

* Follow-up with ex-customers upon expiry of their COE for new sales opportunity

* More complex search operations, to search for multiple fields at once using logical conjunctions like
  'and', 'or' and 'not', as well as brackets.
  
* Email integration Contact customers directly from the app instead of using a separate app.
