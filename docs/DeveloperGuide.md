## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* stores the event book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the event book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Help feature

#### Current Implementation

When called as `help`, the user will be given the concise command-line syntax of all implemented commands and their arguments following the conventions listed in https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax

This is facilitated by `MESSAGE_USAGE_CONCISE` in each `Command` that the user is able to use.

When called as `help [COMMAND]`, the user will be given the detailed description of the usage of the specified `COMMAND`.

This is facilitated by `MESSAGE_USAGE` in each `Command`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `HelpCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user is unsure of the syntax and attempts to type
in the CLI a command that is unlikely to fit the syntax of implemented commands. `AddressBookParser#ParseCommand()` throws a `ParseException` and the user receives a prompt "Unknown command, try the command: help".

Step 2. The user executes `help`. `AddressBookParser#ParseCommand()` instantiates a `HelpCommandParser` to parse the arguments for `help`. Since there are no arguments, the default constructor for `HelpCommand` is called, and the user receives a concise description of the complete set of implemented commands.

Step 3. The user executes `help add`. `AddressBookParser#ParseCommand()` instantiates a `HelpCommandParser` to parse the arguments for `help add`. The constructor taking in a `commandWord` is called, and when `HelpCommand#execute` is run, the `MESSAGE_USAGE` of the `Command` matching the `commandWord` is shown to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the subsequent arguments are not successfully parsed, `help` is called instead. If multiple arguments are found, only the first one is parsed.

</div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How HelpCommand executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Entire help message is composed of `MESSAGE_USAGE_CONCISE` of the various commands in `SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE`, which is printed.
    * Pros: Each `Command` takes care of its own syntax, only needs to be updated at one place for changes to take effect.
    * Cons: The list of commands is still hard coded into `SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE`, and needs to be manually updated every time a new `Command` is implemented.

* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a list of Commands, which `HelpCommand` will iterate over to print the concise syntax for each command when printing the help message.
    * Pros: Need not hard code the possible commands, only have to update the list of commands
    * Cons: Possible reduced performance, especially later if a large number of commands is added.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### [Feature] Adding Persons
The Persons stored inside PartyPlanet should not have any compulsory fields except for name. This is to allow
for addition of contacts where the user is unable to, or does not need to fill up all fields.

One example of such case is a vendor's contact. The user does not need to store information on a vendor's birthday.

Additionally, the user should also be able to store remarks for that contact.

#### Implementation
* The remark is a new class that stores a String containing the specific remark
* Each `Person` class contains fields `Name`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Birthday`, `Email` and `Remark`
    * To allow for optional fields `Address`, `Phone`, `Birthday`, `Email` and `Remark`, each class has an attribute
  `isEmpty` that indicates whether the field in the person is empty.
    * The empty fields will then be stored as an empty string `""` in the `addressbook.json` folder and be read as an
  empty field accordingly.
* Syntax for adding Person: `add -n NAME [-a ADDRESS] [-p PHONE] [-b BIRTHDAY] [-e EMAIL] [-r REMARK]`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add` mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `add -n James -r Loves sweets` command to add a person with name `James` and remark `Loves
   sweets`, represented by `execute("add -n James -r Loves sweets"")`. Note that fields `Address`, `Phone`,
   `Birthday` and `Email` are not specified and hence are empty fields.
2. `LogicManager` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command, represented by `parseCommand("add -n
   James -r Loves sweets")`

Below is the partial sequence diagram for steps 1 and 2.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add -n James -r Loves sweets` Command p1](images/AddSequenceDiagram1.png)

3. `AddressBookParser` creates an `AddCommandParser` which is used to parse the arguments provided by the user. This
   is represented by `parse("-n James -r Loves sweets")`.
4. `AddCommandParser` calls the constructor of a `Person` with the given arguments as input and creates a `Person`
   This is represented by `Person("James", "", "", "", "", "Loves sweets", [])`. Note empty
   string `""` and `[]` represent empty fields.
5. The `AddCommandParser` then passes this newly created `Person` as input to create an `AddCommand` which will be
   returned to the `LogicManager`. This is represented by `AddCommand(p)`

Below is the partial sequence diagram for steps 3, 4 and 5.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add -n James -r Loves sweets` Command p2](images/AddSequenceDiagram2.png)



6. The `LogicManager` executes the `AddCommand` by calling `AddCommand#execute()` and passes the `CommandResult`
   back to the `UI`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add -n James -r Loves sweets` Command p3](images/AddSequenceDiagram3.png)

Given below is the full Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add -n
James -r Loves sweets")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add -n James -r Loves sweets` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

### [Feature] Marking `Event` as Done

We want to allow `Event` to be marked as done. So that the user can easily keep track of what events have been completed,
and what events are upcoming.

`Event` titles could include a tick to represent completion.

#### Implementation
* Syntax for EDoneCommand: `edone INDEX [INDEX]...`
* Modification to `Event` class
  * New attribute `isDone` should be added to represent a done and not done event.
  * A `setDone()` method to return a new `Event` object that is done.
  * A `getStatus()` method that returns a tick if the `Event` is done (for UI display).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `edone` will work.

1. The user executes `edone 1 2 3` command to mark event at index 1, 2 and 3 as done.

2. `LogicManager` calls `parseCommand("edone 1 2 3")` of `AddressBookParser` to parse the input.

3. `AddressBookParser` detects command word `edone` and creates an `EDoneCommandParser`.

4. `AddressBookParser` calls `parse("1 2 3")` of `EDoneCommandParser`.

5. `EDoneCommandParser` processes the input and compiles the valid indexes into a list `List<Index>`.

6. `EDoneCommandParser` creates an `EDoneCommand(List<Index>)` and returns it to `LogicManager`.

7. `LogicManger` excutes the `EDoneCommand`.

8. `EDoneCommand` loops through the list of index, and set the events, at the given index, as a done event.

9. `EDoneCommand` creates an `CommandResult` containing the output message and returns it to `LogicManager`.

Given below is the full Sequence Diagram for interactions for the `execute("edone 1 2 3")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add -n James -r Loves sweets` Command](images/EDoneSequenceDiagram.png)

### [Feature] Autocompleting `Edit` Command (Remark)

Since `Remark`s are intended to be capable of containing long sentences or paragraphs,
it brings an unintended chore of a User having to retype an entire `Remark` in order to edit it.

The Autocomplete feature allows the user to autocomplete a current `Person`'s remark into the
command box once the correct `Person` id and remark prefix has been keyed.

#### Implementation
* Syntax for EditAutocomplete: `edit INDEX -r` + `TAB`
* The user is expected to keypress the TAB key after typing the command in order to activate the autocomplete feature.
* The feature is implemented with the help of a new `EditAutocompleteUtil` class that handles parsing and retrieving the
relavant remark from the `Model`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `EditAutocomplete` will work.

1. The user executes `edit 1 -r` + `TAB` command to autocomplete `Person` 1's Remark.

2. `UI` calls `autocomplete("edit 1 -r")` of `LogicManager` to handle the input.

3. `LogicManager` calls `parseEditCommand("edit 1 -r", model)` of `EditAutocompleteUtil` to parse the input.

4. `EditAutocompleteUtil` processes the input and retrieves the relevant `Person`'s `Remark` from the `Model`.

5. `EditAutocompleteUtil` creates the autocompleted output String and returns it to `LogicManager`.

7. `LogicManger` returns the autocompleted output String to `UI`.

8. `UI` updates `CommandBox` to reflect the autocompleted command input.

Given below is the full Sequence Diagram for interactions for the `edit 1 -r` + `TAB` API call.
