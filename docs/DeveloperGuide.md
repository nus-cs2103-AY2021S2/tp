## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteTask 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `HeyMatezParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTask 1` Command](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Hey Matez data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section documents some of the noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented

### Mark as completed / uncompleted features

The implementation of the mark as completed and uncompleted features are facilitated by the `DoneTaskCommand` and `
UndoTaskCommand` classes respectively, both of which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also facilitated by the following Parser Classes:
* `DoneTaskCommandParser`
* `UndoTaskCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser classes all inherit the `#parse` method from the Parser interface.

* `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current DoneCommand is valid and creates an DoneTaskCommand instance if it is.
* `UndoTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current Undo Command is valid and creates an UndoTaskCommand instance if it is.

Subsequently, the created `DoneTaskCommand` / `UndoTaskCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
updating the status of the Task to "completed" or "uncompleted". This is achieved by creating a new `Task` object with the
same fields and values but updating the `TaskStatus` field according to the input.

Below is the usage scenario and how the mark the task as completed mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task with **uncompleted** status

Step 1. User executes the `done 1` command to mark the task with index number 1 in the task list of HEY MATEz to be completed. 
 A ` DoneTaskCommandParser` object is created and it calls `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` on the arguments

Step 2. `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` method will check on the validity of the arguments for a `DoneTaskCommand`. If it
is valid,  it will call the create a new `DoneTaskCommand` by calling the constructor.

Step 3. The `DoneTaskCommand#execute` is then called by the `LogicManager`. The task with the same `Index` is retrieved and
a copy of the task is created with the same attribute values. However. the `TaskStatus` value is updated to be **completed**'
in the `Model`.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_DONE_TASK_SUCCESS` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram:

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `done 1` Command](images/DoneTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find Tasks with deadline before a selected date feature

The implementation of the finding of tasks with deadline before a selected date is facilitated by the `FindTasksBeforeCommand`
class, from the Command abstract class.

It is also facilitated by the following Parser Class:
* `FindTasksBeforeCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser class inherits the `#parse` method from the Parser interface.

* `FindTasksBeforeParser#parse` - checks if the deadline passed to the current FindTasksBeforeCommand is in the correct format and is valid, then creates a FindTasksBeforeCommand instance if they are.


Subsequently, the created `FindTasksBeforeCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
updating the task list to contain the tasks with deadlines before the selected date. This is achieved by calling on `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`
with the DeadlineBeforeDatePredicate which updates the task list with tasks that match the given predicate.

Below is the usage scenario and how the finding of tasks due before a selected date mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has existing tasks with their corresponding deadlines

Step 1. User executes the `findBefore 2021-04-04` command to show the tasks in the task list of HEY MATEz with deadline before 2021-04-04.  A
`FindTasksBeforeCommandParser` is created and it calls `FindTasksBeforeParser#parse` on the arguments

Step 2. `FindTasksBeforeCommandParser#parse` method will check on the validity of the deadline argument for a `FindTasksBeforeCommand`. If is is
valid,  it will create a new `FindTasksBeforeCommand` by calling the constructor with the DeadlineBeforeDatePredicate.

Step 3. The `FindTasksBeforeCommand#execute` is then called by the `LogicManager`. The tasks with deadline before 2021-04-04 are selected by the 
DeadlineBeforeDatePredicate.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_TASKS_LISTED_OVERVIEW,` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram:

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `findBefore 2021-04-04` Command](images/FindBeforeSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete a Task feature

The implementation of the deleting a Task feature is facilitated by the DeleteTaskCommand, which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also enabled by the following Parser class:
* `DeleteTaskCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser class inherits from the `#parse method` from the Parser interface.

* `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parser` - checks if the arguments passed to the current DeleteTaskCommand is valid. 
  If the arguments are valid, it creates a DeleteTaskCommand instance.

Subsequently, the created `DeleteTaskCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which 
is responsible for deleting the given Task with respect to the index. 

Below is the usage scenario of how delete task mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task

Step 1. User executes the `deleteTask 1` command to delete the task at the 1st index in the task list of HEY MATEz. 
A `DeleteTaskCommandParser` is created and calls the `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse` on the arguments.

Step 2. `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse` method checks on the validity of the arguments for a `DeleteTaskCommand`. 
If it is valid, it will create a new `DeleteTaskCommand` by calling the constructor.

Step 3. The `DeleteTaskCommand#execute` is then called by `Logic Manager`. The task with the same `Index` is retrieved 
and deleted from the task list using the `deleteTask` method in the `Model` class.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_DELETE_TASK_SUCCESS` is used to return a 
new Command Result with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram: 

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTask 1` Command](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

### Clear all Assignee of a Task feature

The implementation of clearing all `Assignee` of a Task feature is facilitated by the `ClearAssigneeCommand` 
class which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also facilitated by the following Parser Classes:
* `ClearAssigneesCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser classes all inherit the `#parse` method from the Parser interface.

* `ClearAssigneesCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current ClearAssigneeCommand is valid. 
  If the arguments are valid, it creates a ClearAssigneeCommand instance.

Subsequently, the created `ClearAssigneeCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
clearing all `Assignee` of the Task, with respect to its index. This is achieved by creating a new 
`Task` object with the same fields and values but setting the Set<Assignee> field as a new empty HashSet. 

Below is the usage scenario of how clear all assignee of a Task mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task with **assignee**

Step 1. User executes the `clearAssignees 1` command to mark the task with index number 1 in the task list of 
HEY MATEz to be cleared. A ` ClearAssigneesCommandParser` object is created and it calls `ClearAssigneesCommandParser#parse` 
on the arguments.

Step 2. `ClearAssigneesCommandParser#parse` method will check on the validity of the arguments for a `ClearAssigneesCommand`. 
If it is valid,  it will call the create a new `ClearAssigneesCommand` by calling the constructor.

Step 3. The `ClearAssigneesCommand#execute` is then called by the `LogicManager`. The task with the same `Index` 
is retrieved and a copy of the task is created with the same attribute values. However. the `Set<Assignee>` field is 
updated to be a new empty HashSet in the `Model`.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_CLEARED_ASSIGNEES_SUCCESS` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram:
