## **Description**

The Food Diary is a **desktop app for managing food diary entries**, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The Food Diary **caters to food-passionate NUS students** who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

The Food Diary will **allow students to save time and effort** when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity. 
The Food Diary especially caters to students chiefly on 3 aspects:
1. The ability for users to log personal food reviews tagged under different categories for future reference;
1. The ability to effortlessly reference food options based on relevant filters in a user-friendly GUI; and
1. The ability to import and export their personal food diary to share with friends.

## **Design**
### Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)
The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called `Main` and `MainApp`. It is responsible for, 
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.
* `UI`: The UI of the App.
* `Logic`: The command executor.
* `Model`: Holds the data of the App in memory.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,
* defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component. 
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` 
  class which implements the corresponding API interface mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) 
defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality 
using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Logic Class Diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

#### How the architecture components interact with each other
The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario 
where the user issues the command `addon 1 re/i like this food`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component. 

### UI component

### Logic Component
**API:** [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fooddiary/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FoodDiaryParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an entry to the Food Diary)
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is
passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions,
such as displaying help to the user.
   
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("addon 1 re/Good")` API call.

![AddOn Sequence Diagram](images/AddOn_Sequence_Diagram.png)

### Model Component
![Model Architecture Diagram](images/ModelArchitectureDiagram.png)

**API :** `Model.java`

The `Model`,
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
- stores the user's food entries data.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be ‘observed’ e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that 
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- does not depend on any of the other three components.


### Storage Component

### Common classes
Classes used by multiple components are in the seedu.fooddiary.commons package.






## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### AddOn Feature
#### Implementation
The AddOn feature allows the user to add review(s) and/or a price to a single entry of a food place. This will be useful
for users who frequently visit a particular place and would like to enter their reviews and the price spent every visit.
The reviews are added to the specifed entry and the price added on will be refelcted as a price range the of the user's spending history 
(e.g. if the current entry has a price of $5, adding on a price of 10 will update the current price of 5 to a price range of $5-10)
This feature follows the architecture of AB3.

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddOn feature works:
![AddOn Sequence Diagram](images/AddOn_Sequence_Diagram.png)

The following activity diagram summaries the flow of event when a user executes the addon command:
![AddOn_Activity_Diagram](images/AddOn_Activity_Diagram.png)

### FindAll Feature
#### Implementation
The FindAll feature allows a user to find entries that match all the keywords provided by the user.
This enables the user to easily sieve out all the entries that meet every single requirement the user
is looking for, which will be useful when deciding where to eat.

The FindAll feature is similar to the Find feature. The Find feature finds for all entries that meet
at least one of the given keywords, while the FindAll feature only finds for entries that meet all the
given keywords.

One of the alternatives considered was to make the Find command serve the purpose of both the Find & FindAll
commands, as they behave similarly. However, this would require the user to key in additional syntax to
specify which method of find they would like to use. This was deemed to be less user-friendly and more prone
to errors as the command now consists of 3 parts (command word, type of find to use & keywords to find),
instead of 2 (command word & keywords to find). As a result, FindAll was implemented as a separate feature.

The following sequence diagram shows how the FindAll feature works:
![FindAll Sequence Diagram](images/FindAllSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises the events that take place when a user executes the FindAll
command:
![FindAll Activity Diagram](images/FindAllActivityDiagram.png)

### Revise Feature
#### Implementation
The Revise feature allows a user to quickly edit different sections of an entry. It is often misunderstood to be 
mutually exclusive with the edit feature or the slower alternative. This feature shines when a user wishes to edit 
while also adding into multiple sections in an entry. The edit and addon features are still necessities for making 
quick and small chanegs to an entry.

The command opens an additional window when a user enters the command in the UI, the command will be passed into 
`MainWindow#executeCommand()`, in which `Logic#execute()` will be called to parse the user input in  `FoodDiaryParser#parseCommand()`.
The user input will be parsed as a 'Revise' command and executed to retrieve all the details related to the specified entry.
With the window for revision of the entry, a user can easily make changes to the sections all at once. 

With the revise button, all the changes made are passed into the `MainWindow#executeCommand()`, and makes its way to 
`ReviseCommand#revise()` with calls `MainWindow#executeCommand()` with the content at each section concatenated with its
prefix and the EditCommand. 

The following sequence diagram shows how Revise feature works:
![FindAll Sequence Diagram](images/ReviseSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises the events that take place when a user executes the Revise
command:
![Revise Activity Diagram](images/ReviseActivityDiagram.png)


### View Feature
`View`: Allows the user to view a specified entry in a new window, allowing the user to carefully look through
all the details of an entry. This feature is mainly used to read lengthy food reviews which cannot be shown on the Main 
UI window.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user launches The Food Diary application. Data will be loaded from the storage to the application memory. 
The `FoodDiary` will be populated with a list of `Entry`, each contains: `Name`, `Address`, `Price` 
, `Rating`, `Review`, `TagCategory` and `TagSchool`.

Step 2. The user executes `View <INDEX>`, for whichever entry with lengthy reviews he/she wants to view.

Step 3. If the user input is invalid, an error message will be displayed in the command box, If the entry specified do
not exist, the filteredEntryList will be empty and no entry will be displayed on the Main Window.  

The mechanism works in such a way where after the user enters a command in the UI, the command will be passed into
`MainWindow#executeCommand()`, in which `Logic#execute()` will be called to parse the user input in
`FoodDiaryParser#parseCommand()`. The parsed command will be recognised as a 'View' command and executed to 
retrieve all the details related to the specified entry. The result of this execution will be passed back to the UI and 
shown in a new window.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `View` feature works:
![View Sequence Diagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `View` command:
![View Activity Diagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: Whether to view entry with lengthy reviews in the Main UI or in a new window.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** View entry with lengthy reviews in a new window.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, do not need to deal with complex UI codes. Entry information looks neater.
    * Cons: User has to close/minimize the window to return to Main Window.
* **Alternative 2:** View entry with lengthy reviews in the Main UI.
    * Pros: Design is integrated within Main UI, which gives it a cleaner look.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement, lesser time for testability given the project deadline duration.

## **Appendix E: Non-Functional Requirements**

Non-functional requirements specify the constraints under which the system for The Food Diary is developed and operated.
The Food Diary system is made up of the front-end, which is interchangeably referred to as the User Interface (UI),
and the back-end, which handles data management and operations.

### Technical requirements:

* The system should be operable on Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems, with Java 11 or above installed.

### Performance requirements:

* The system should be loaded up within 2 seconds or less.
* The UI should appear within 2 seconds or less and be responsive to User input.
* The back-end should be responsive to processing User input at the same time the UI appears.
* The back-end should be able to handle 1,000 or more data entries (Food Diary entries) without noticeable sluggishness
  in performance for typical usage.

### Usability requirements:

* The user should have access to a keyboard, and be proficient with typing alphanumeric English characters for commands
  to accomplish most of the usages of The Food Diary.

### Project scope:
* The system should mainly comprise the handling of Food Diary-entry addition, deletion, and listing.
* The system would not be responsible for features involving multiple users

### Scalability requirements:
* The system can handle a larger user base with many more food reviews being added to it
* Program is extendable for future addition of features easily

### Other Noteworthy Points:

* The system should preserve data keyed in by the user

## **Appendix F: Glossary**
The glossary serves to ensure that all stakeholders, including users, have a common understanding of the noteworthy terms, and abbreviations.

* **Sluggishness**: The system starts to be slow in displaying user input when typed, and processing user input when entered.
