## **Design**

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgetbaby/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgetbaby/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`BudgetBabyLogic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`BudgetBabyModel`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`BudgetBabyStorage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `BudgetBabyLogic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `BudgetBabyLogic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `BudgetBabyLogicManager.java` class which implements the `BudgetBabyLogic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add-fr d/Lunch a/10`.

[To be updated]
![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgetbaby/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts. It is made up of a `HelpWindow`, `BudgetDisplay`, `FinancialRecordListPanel`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and a `StatusBarFooter`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the logic component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API**:
[`BudgetBabyLogic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgetbaby/logic/BudgetBabyLogic.java)

1. `BudgetBabyLogic` uses the `BudgetBabyParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `BudgetBabyCommand` object which is executed by the `BudgetBabyLogicManager`
3. The command execution can affect the `BudgetBabyModel` (e.g. adding a financial record).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add-fr d/Lunch a/10")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add-fr d/Lunch a/10` Command](images/AddFinancialRecordSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddFrCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`BudgetBabyModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgetbaby/model/BudgetBabyModel.java)

The `BudgetBabyModel`,

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
- stores the budget tracker data.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Month>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<FinancialRecord>` that can be 'observed' (same as above)
- does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component [To be updated]

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`BudgetBabyStorage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgetbaby/storage/BudgetBabyStorage.java)

The `Storage` component,

- can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
- can save the budget tracker data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.budgetbaby.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Month Management Feature

#### `view-month` command

To be updated by Xinyue

### Financial Record Management Feature

To be updated by Xinyue

### Budget Management Feature

#### `set-bg` command

To be updated by Yu Heem

### [Completed] Find Financial Record Feature : `find-fr`

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed `find` mechanism is facilitated by `BudgetBabyModelManager` which contains
a filtered list `filteredFinancialRecords` that is to be altered and displayed to the
user according to the `find-fr` command.

The command is parsed from `BudgetBabyCommandParser` to the `FindFrCommandParser` class,
where the input fields will be processed before instantiating a new valid `FindFrCommand`.
The `FindFrCommand` calls the `findFinancialRecord` method of the `BudgetBabyModel` that
is implemented by `BudgetBabyModelManager`. `BudgetBabyModelManager` then handles the
filtering of `filteredFinancialRecords` through the `updateFilteredFinancialRecordList`
method. The updated financial records are then displayed to the user on the front end of
the application.

The `findFinancialRecord` method expects a minimum of 1 and up to 3 of the following arguments:
`Description`, `Amount`, `Category`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `filteredFinancialRecords` list
presented to the user would be a list of all financial records retrieved from local storage
`budgetbaby.json` (if applicable).

Step 2. The user executes `find-fr d/Lunch a/10 c/Food` command to find financial records with
description `Lunch`, amount `10` and category `Food`. The `find-fr` command indirectly calls the
`updateFilteredFinancialRecordList` method, causing `filteredFinancialRecords` to display the matching
records without modifying the contents of the original financial records list.

- Note: If no matching financial record(s) is/are found,
then the list will not be updated and a log message
indicating no records found will be shown.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:
![](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `find-fr`:
![](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Extensions Implemented
- `c/FR_CATEGORY` field accepts multiple categories
- Display an appropriate message if no matching financial records found

#### Design Consideration

- Alternative 1 (selected choice): A single `find-fr` command that handles all fields
    - Pros: Eliminates the need to implement separate search features. Allows
      filtering multiple fields in a single command
    - Cons: May cause confusion in usage. Some users may find it cumbersome to deal with
      `d/` `a/` `c/` tags

- Alternative 2: Separate `find-description`, `find-amount`, `find-category` commands
    - Pros: May be less confusing to users and eliminates the use of `d/` `a/` `c/` tags
    - Cons: Additional implementation and commands. More steps required for user
    when filtering multiple fields

### [Completed] Reset Filter Feature : `reset-filter`

#### Actual Implementation

This feature was developed in conjunction with `find-fr`. As the financial records list can
be filtered to the flags set by the user, there must be a way for the user to revert this list
back to its original state (i.e. displaying all financial records).

Similar to the mechanism of the find operation, the `ResetFilterCommand` calls 

The `ResetFilterCommand` calls the `resetFilter` method of the `BudgetBabyModel` that
is implemented by `BudgetBabyModelManager`. `BudgetBabyModelManager` then handles the
resetting of filter on `filteredFinancialRecords` through the `updateFilteredFinancialRecordList`
method. The updated original financial records are then displayed to the user on the
front end of the application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `reset` mechanism behaves at each step
with the `find-fr` command initially applied

Step 1. The user executes `find-fr d/Lunch a/10 c/Food` command which filters and displays
the updated financial records list

Step 2. The user is satisfied with his query result and wishes to revert the financial records
list back to its original state. The `reset-filter` command is executed which indirectly calls the
`updateFilteredFinancialRecordList` method, causing `filteredFinancialRecords` to display all
available financial records.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
University student who needs to manage their finances.

**Value proposition**: <br>
Most university students have a limited budget every month and are moving towards financial independence.
During this transition, university students may seek external tools to manage their finances.
Hence, we believe a budget tracker application that records monthly expenses would benefit university
students as they adjust themselves, easing into adulthood.

- Optimised for university students by
  - setting monthly psending goals as university students have limited budgets
  - allowing university students to categorize their spendings with custom categories suiting their diverse lifestyles
  - providing statistics to help university students better visualize their spending habits and make future plans
    (i.e. to cut down on costs incurred on food next month)
  - sending reminders to keep university students on track (i.e. how much money is left in their budget) as they are often busy with school
