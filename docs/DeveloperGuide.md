## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/ay2021s2-cs2103-t16-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/ay2021s2-cs2103-t16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/ay2021s2-cs2103-t16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/ay2021s2-cs2103-t16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ResidenceTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a residence).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/ay2021s2-cs2103-t16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)
The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the residence tracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Residence>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ResidenceTracker`, which `Residence` references. This allows `ResidenceTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Residence` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/ay2021s2-cs2103-t16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the residence tracker data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Remind feature

#### Implementation

The proposed mechanism is facilitated by the `logic` component described above. It filters the displayed `Residence` list to show those with bookings starting in the next 7 days. It makes use of the following new method in `Residence`.

* `Residence#hasUpcomingBooking()` — Returns true if the `Residence` has a booking starting in the next 7 days.

These operations make use of the `Model` interface's `Model#updateFilteredResidenceList(Predicate<Residence> predicate)` method and `Model` has a new public static `Predicate` named `PREDICATE_UPCOMING_BOOKED_RESIDENCES`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reminder filtering mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ResidenceTracker` will be initialized with the initial residence tracker state.

Step 2. The user executes `addb 2 n/New Tenant p/098 ...` command to add a booking that starts within the next 7 days to the 2nd residence in the residence tracker. The `addb` command calls `Residence#addBooking(Booking booking)`, which replaces the 2nd residence with the new `Residence` after the command execution.

Step 3. The user executes `remind` to list all residences with upcoming bookings. The `remind` command also calls `Model#updateFilteredResidenceList(Predicate<Residence> predicate)`, causing a filtered list of `Residence`s to be displayed which includes the updated residence from the previous step.

Step 4. Any successful execution of commands `add`, `addb`, `edit`, `editb`, `delete`, `deleteb` or `list` will return to the previous display of the full residence list.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Checks if residences have bookings starting in the next 7 days.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: User is forced to actively use the command to be reminded.

* **Alternative 2:** Residences are automatically displayed with residences having upcoming bookings on top.
    * Pros: Users will be able to see the residences that need the most urgent attention on top of their list without interacting with the app.
    * Cons: The users will not be able to tell how many in the list will need to be cleaned immediately for the next 7 days. 
      Using colour codes to differentiate the residences from the rest will make it visually more unpleasant for the users as it already uses colour coding for bookings.

### Status feature

#### Implementation

The proposed mechanism is facilitated by the `logic` component described above. It updates clean status of multiple `Residences` at one time. It makes use of the following new method.

* `StausCommand#createUpdatedResidence()` —  Create updated residence with the required clean status and the same other data.
* `StausCommandParser#paser()` —  Manage the status command input, return a status command with required clean status and target residence index list.

These operations make use of the `Model` interface's `Model#updateFilteredResidenceList(Predicate<Residence> predicate)` method to update the order of residence list, 
and `Model#setResidence()` to update the residence in the residence list. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `status` filtering mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ResidenceTracker` will be initialized with the initial residence tracker state.

Step 2. The user executes two or more input`add n/NAME a/ADDRESS c/y ...` command to add multiple residence with the same clean status "CLEAN". The `add` command calls `addResidence()` which checks and adds new residence to the end of unique residence list where "UNCLEAN" residences is in front of "CLEAN" residences. 

Step 3. The user executes `status unclean 4 5` to update the forth and fifth residences' clean status to "UNCLEAN". The `status` command also calls `Model#updateFilteredResidenceList(Predicate<Residence> predicate)`, causing an ordered list of `Residence`s to be displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the status operation works:

![StatusSequenceDiagram](images/StatusSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `status` command:

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a residence

1. Deleting a residence while all residence are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all residences using the `list` command. Multiple residences in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First residence is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted residence shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No residence is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with corrupted data files

    1. Prerequisites: There are some stored residences in the residence tracker. The app is closed.

    1. Test case: corrupted `residencetracker.json` <br>
       Steps: First edit the `residencetracker.json` such that it becomes an invalid format by removing a single `}` at the end of the file. Open the residence tracker.<br>
       Expected: The residence tracker will start but the residence list will be empty (i.e all previous data is lost). Add a few residences and try other commands. They should work as expected.

    1. Test case: missing `residencetracker.json` <br>
       Steps: Exit the residence tracker. First delete the `residencetracker.json` from the `/data` directory. Open the residence tracker.<br>
       Expected: The residence tracker will start with only the sample data.
