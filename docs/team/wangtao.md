## Project: Residence Tracker

ResidenceTracker (RT) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RT can get your residence management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: a new feature of residence -- cleanStatusTag
    * What it is: A remarkable sign to show the clean status of residence which help users clearly know whether the residence is clean or not, and arrange for home cleaning company to provide service in time. 
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as airbnb managers, they could manage the residences more conveniently with the help of this feature and avoid complaints caused by poor cleanup.
    * Highlights: cleanStatusTag as a residence feature is applied to all aspects of the project. "add"and "edit" command can initialize and change it. 

* **New Feature**: new command "status"
    * What it is: a convenient command to update clean status of multiple residences.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because clean status is a special tag which is changed often, and after users call someone to clean residences, it usually needs to update more than one clean status. as busy managers, they definitely don’t want to waste time updating them one by one. So this command can save users' time.
    * Highlights: cleanStatusTag as a residence feature is applied to all aspects of the project. "add"and "edit" command can initialize and change it.
