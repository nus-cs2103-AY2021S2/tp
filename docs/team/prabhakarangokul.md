### The Food Diary Project 

#### About the project 
- The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

- The Food Diary caters to food-passionate NUS students who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

- The Food Diary will allow students to save time and effort when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity.

- **Enhancements implemented:**
    - Add On command
        - This command Allows users to quickly add on parameters like Price and Reviews to existing 
          Food Diary Entries.
        - Previously reviews and prices cannot be added to a Food Diary Entry (e.g. KFC) With this add on command, 
          users are able to add multiple reviews and a price range easily, without have to delete and add a brand new entry
    - Refactored the Food Diary entries to contain multiple reviews instead of being restricted to a single review
    - Added a price range to the Food Diary entries
