## Project: NUS Module Planner

NUS Module planner is a brownfield project based on AddressBook - Level 3, a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
