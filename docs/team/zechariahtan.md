## Project: Green Mileage Efforts
Green Mileage Efforts - is a shared desktop application used to make finding groups of people to carpool with easier. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `listPool` command feature. (Pull requests [\#227](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/227))
    * What it does: Allows the user to list all existing pools.
    * Justification: As there exists a feature to filter the pool list, the listPool command allows the user to remove all existing filters and view the full list.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=zechariah&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=ZechariahTan&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Model:
    * Added TripDay, TripTime, Person, Driver, and Pool classes to the model to allow for further extension of previous versions. (Pull requests [#53](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/53), [#91](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/91), [#100](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/100), [#111](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/111))
    * Added PoolList to AddressBook to allow for the tracking of pools created. (Pull request [#113](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/113))
    * Refactored existing code to fit new model format (Pull requests [#40](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/40))
  * Logic:
    * Added listPool command to fix feature bug where pool list cannot be refreshed to show all pools after filtering the list with findPool command. (Pull request [#227](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/227))
  * Testing:
    * Added test code for TripDay, TripTime, Person, and Driver classes.
    * Added test code for Pool, and Unpool classes, as well as their respective parsers
