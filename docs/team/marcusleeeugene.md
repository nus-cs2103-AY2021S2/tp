## Project: The Food Diary

The Food Diary - The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 7.5k LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Revise Command**: Added the ability to allow users to quickly make corrections to existing data in the UI with shortcut keys.
    * What it does: Opens up a window, showing the existing details of a FoodDiary entry and allows for quick corrections and updates without requiring the use of prefixes and command syntax in the UI.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make corrections to existing data quickly, without losing previous entry details.


* **View Command**: Added the ability to allow users to open an expanded view for entries that are very lengthy.
    * What it does: Opens up a window, showing the details of a specified FoodDiary entry in a full expanded view. Allows the user to read through reviews that are too lengthy to be shown in the main UI window.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to view entry reviews that are too lengthy to be shown in the entry card. All the data are projected onto the view window UI and also separates reviews within the entry for easier view.
