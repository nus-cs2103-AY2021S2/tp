## Project: ClientBook

ClientBook is a contact management application for insurance agents to have convenient access to a central avenue of all client related information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added lock and unlock commands
    * What it does: allows user to secure their client data from unauthorised access.
    * Justification: insurance agents are always on the go and sometimes, their laptops might be unattended. This features gives them a peace of mind that their clients' information is secured.
    * Highlights: creatively made use of a zip file's encryption and decryption process instead of creating own cryptography library.
    * Credits: zip4j library was used to lock and unlock a zip file.
    

* **New Feature**: Added "insurance policies owned" attribute for each client contact.
    * What it does: allows the user to indicate insurance policies owned by a client.
    * Justification: makes accessing a client's insurance policies convenient instead of having to look it up in the company's files.


* **New Feature**: Added keyboard commands
    * What it does: when a keyboard command is pressed, the corresponding command keyword is filled into the command box.
    * Justification: insurance agents are busy and hence this feature reduces time spent typing in command keywords.
