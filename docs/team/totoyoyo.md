## Project: MeetBuddy

MeetBuddy is ---.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort contacts
    * What it does: allows the user to sort the contact lists using a specifc property of the contacts
    * Justification: helps the user organize the contact in a convenient way


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to unsort contacts
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed
      by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and
      the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
      analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing
      commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in
      the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Team-tasks contributions**:
    * Set up the GitHub repository and team organization for the project
    * Managed GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration
    * Created and maintained issues on GitHub to keep track of tasks and progress
    * Create Google Docs files for project notes and drafts of UG
    * Provide location for offline meeting
    * Label bug reports for easier task division

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36]()
      , [\#38]())
