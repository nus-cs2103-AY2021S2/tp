## Project: SpamEZ

SpamEZ is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It helps users to classify contacts based on their details in order to facilitate effective and efficient information dissemination to a large audience.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `Mode of Contact` field to `Person`.
  * What it does: Allows users to specify the preferred mode of contact to each contact.
  * Justification: This feature ensures that the information sent by the user is properly received by the contacts.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and future commands that acts on the fields of the Person Class.
  * Credits: The implementation of this feature is mainly inspired from AB3 developer guide.


* **New Feature**: Added `Light` and `Dark` command
  * What it does: Allows users change between light and dark mode.
  * Justification: This feature reduces the amount of stress on the eyes of the user.
  * Highlights: Implementing the `Light` and `Dark` commands requires a deep understanding of multiple front end components. As it is a persistent feature that allows the user to toggle between modes.
