## Project: ModuleBook3.5

ModuleBook3.5 is a desktop module book application used for keeping track of tasks for various NUS modules
in an *Easy, Seamless and Straightforward* manner. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a task as done or not done.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark a task as done. If user wishes to attempt the task again, the task can also be marked as not done.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to re-attempt a task 
    and the app should provide a convenient way for the user to indicate that the previously done task is actually not done yet.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future.
    The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added a workload field that allows the user to rate a task's expected workload 
  using integers in the range 1-3 inclusive
  * What it does: allows the user to indicate an estimation of how much effort is required for a task
  * Justification: This feature can be used in conjunction with sorting to allow users to prioritise tasks with higher workload
  * Highlights: This enhancement required changes to existing commands to support adding and changing of workload field
