## Project: Vax@NUS

Vax@NUS is a one stop management app to efficiently track and schedule COVID-19 vaccinations for NUS students. It is a desktop app optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit existing appointments. [\#161](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/161)
    * What it does: Allows the user to edit the details of existing vaccination appointments in the system, should the need arise. 
    * Justification: This feature accounts for the unforeseen circumstances that could appear when vaccination appointments are scheduled, and gives the user more flexibility in rescheduling appointments, or fixing accidental input mistakes. 
    * Highlights: This feature is similar to the `addAppt` command in terms of syntax, so a lot of coordination with my teammate who implemented that command was required.

* **Project management**:
    * Refactored the AB3 code base to better suit the naming conventions of Vax@NUS.[\#123](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/123)  
    * Updated project ReadMe [\#58](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/58) [\#291](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/291)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the `add` command from original AB3 form to current Vax@NUS form. While there were only 5 parameters initially, there are currently 9. [\#82](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/82)
    * Updated the `edit` command from original AB3 form to current Vax@NUS form. The new parameters all had to be accounted for. [\#82](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/82)

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `add`, `edit` and `editAppt` [\#87](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/87) [\#99](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/99) [\#169](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/169)
        * Added the `Input Formats` section to improve user guide usability. [\#149](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/149)
        * Added the Q&A section. 
        * Contributed to the Command Summary section. 
    * Developer Guide:
        * Updated UML diagrams of the Model component and the `Add` command.
        * Updated the Implementation section for the `Add` command. 
        * Added use cases for `editAppt`.[\#299](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/299)
        * Added manual test cases for `add` and `editAppt`. [also in \#299](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/299)

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#139](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/139)
