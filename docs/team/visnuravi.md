## Project: NuFash

NuFash is a desktop clothing application used for organising wardrobes, and taking better clothing decisions. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 
12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Visnu&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=VisnuRavi&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancement to Existing Feature**: Added the ability to find clothings based on various attributes
  * What it does: allows the user to input various types of attributes, and filters out the clothing based on his input
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user would require to easily find his
    clothing based on the various attributes, to view them, know where he placed them, or even to know whether he has
    a particular clothing.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects some of our new features, such as the match feature which relies heavily on the
    find feature, and potentially new features as well. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. 
    The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing find command, taking in 
    multiple different attributes of a garment, manipulating the input to a suitable format, and then making use of
    this format to give the correct output to the user. <br><br>
    
* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the Model from being Person to a Garment.
  * Updated the attributes, such as Phone Number, of the Person to fit the attributes of a Garment, such as Size.
  * Added new parent and subclasses of predicates, which allows the find and match features to find the right 
    garments to output.
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase test coverage.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `clear` and `find`
