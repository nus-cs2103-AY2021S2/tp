## Project: SunRez

**SunRez** is a desktop app designed for college residential staff to efficiently manage student housing services. It features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added support for issues
  * What it does: The issue feature allows the user to track issues that pertain to certain rooms in SunRez.
  * Justification: This feature is needed as Users need to be able to keep a record of issues that happen to rooms so as to address them. The ability to see a record of issues also allows the user to identify rooms that maybe prone to damages.
  * Highlights: This feature entailed an intermediate amount of considerations in how it would integrate with the room feature due to issues being tied to rooms. Although it is not heavily coupled with rooms, future adjustment to rooms need to take into account how issues might be affected.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=stein414&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the issue features `iadd`, `ilist`, `ifind`, `iedit`, `iclos` and `idel`.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Wrote uses cases UC-012 to UC-016.
    * Update implementation details of the `UI` component.
    * Added manual testing instructions for the issue features.
