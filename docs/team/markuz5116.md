## Project: RemindMe

RemindMe is a desktop application for keeping track of user events and deadlines, optimised for use via Command Line 
Interface(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphic User Interface(GUI).
RemindMe allows students to always be aware of exams and events deadline as there will be reminder pop-ups and calendar
for students to see!

Given below are my contributions to the project.\
