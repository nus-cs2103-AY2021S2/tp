## Project: NuFash

NuFash is a desktop clothing application used for organising wardrobes, and taking better clothing decisions.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about
12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Arihant%20Jain&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19)


* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancement to Existing Feature**: Added the ability to select garment based on user input
    * What it does: Select a garment to check out of the wardrobe, indicating that it shall be worn today.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user would require to easily select his
      garment, allowing nufash to know that the particular garment has been checked out for the day.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects some of our new features, such as the view feature, and potentially new features as well. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
      The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing add and delete commands. <br><br>

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the attributes, such as DressCode, of the Person to fit the attributes of a Garment.
    * Added the LastUse attribute, to allow the garment to be viewed by date of last use.
    * Updated the observable list sorting order, to ensure that the garments are compartmentalised.
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase test coverage.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Finalised the documentation of entire UG
