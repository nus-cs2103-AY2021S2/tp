## Project: FlashBack

FlashBack is a desktop flashcard application to help improve the performance of students via improved accessibility and organisation of notes, together with interactive sessions that enhance memory retention. The user interacts with it using a CLI. It is written in Java and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
