### Project: imPoster

imPoster is a desktop application for beginners of API development to easily grasp the basics. The application is optimised for fast typists and can be fully operated through a Command Line Interface. My contributions to the project are as listed below:

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tlylt&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19)

#### New Features & Enhancements

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to send a request without saving the endpoint.

  - What it does: allows the user to run API requests without saving. 
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a
    user can quickly type in an API URL with the required details, and the app 
    will conveniently trigger a request for the user to view the response.
  - Highlights: This feature involves two variations of [command format](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) that can be accepted. It required an 
    in-depth analysis of command parsing order ensuring user inputs are treated correctly. The implementation too was 
    challenging as it required changes to how we verify the validity of URLs.

- **New Feature**: Added a keyboard shortcut that allows the user to retrieve the previous valid command using 
  <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>up-arrow</kbd> (Windows) / <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>up-arrow</kbd> (macOS).

- **New Feature**: Added a help command that allows the user to open a pop up window displaying
   relevant links such as the product's user guide and also a table of command summary for quick reference. 

- **New Feature**: Added a show command that allows the user to view the details of a saved endpoint.

- **Enhancements**:

  - Refactored code in the request calling logic, and the handling of command result to reduce duplication and improve 
    code quality.
  - Fixed issues related to user input (such as the integer index) involved in various commands to ensure bugs are 
    caught and relevant error messages are provided.
