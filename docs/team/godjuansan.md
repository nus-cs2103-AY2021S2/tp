## Project: Dictionote


**Dictionote** is a desktop application that helps CS2103T students in finding information about the module's materials and writing notes about them. It is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) users so that searching and writing operations can be done quickly by typing in commands.

Here are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Create, Read, Edit, and Delete Notes (together with jessen11 (https://github.com/jessen11/)).
  * What it does: User can create, read, edit and delete notes.
  * Justification: In a note-taking application, it is very important to have all the basic features such as these 4 features.
  * Highlights: User can CRUD notes from CLI.

* **New Feature**: Merge two notes into a single note.
  * What it does: Allows user to merge 2 notes into a single note easily.
  * Justification: In a note-taking application, this feature is important as user might want to combine certain notes that he/she feels should be better fit if put together in a single note.
  * Highlights: User can comfortably merge two notes into one fomr the CLI.

* **New Feature**: Give tags to note.
  * What it does: Allows the user to give multiple tags to a single note.
  * Justification: Tags give user more flexibility when storing notes and opens more possibilities of features in the future. For instance, search with tags is a useful feature that we implement after finishing this tagging feature.
  * Highlights: User can managed their notes easily by putting tags on them.

* **New Feature**: Mark a note as done or not done yet.
  * What it does: Allows the user to mark certain notes as done and differentiate them from notes that are not done yet.
  * Justification: The user can easily remember whether they have done a certain notes or have not done it yet.
  * Highlights: With just a single one-liner CLI command, user can remember which notes is already done very easily.

* **New Feature**: Convert note into .txt file.
  * What it does: Convert a note that is stored in our local storage application into a .txt file.
  * Justification: User might want to export their notes somewhere else and rather than having to manually copy and paste everything, this feature can be useful.
  * Highlights: User can just type a one-liner command and will be able to get a .txt file rather than manually copy and paste everything.
