## Project: EzManage

EzManage - EzManage is a desktop application used for the management of a tuition centre's sessions, students and tutors. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added person ID.
  * What it does: Allows the user to identify persons using a unique ID given to each person when the person is added into EzManage.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can easily differentiate between a student and a tutor based on the person ID and the user can uniquely identify each person using a unique person ID. This feature is important because the user will need to use the person ID to use all the other person-related features in EzManage.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. 
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3
