## Project: Residence Tracker

ResidenceTracker (RT) is a **desktop app for managing residences, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RT can get your residence management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Booking List on GUI app
  * What it does: Allows the users to view the list of bookings associated with each residence in the GUI app.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as alongside with the addition of the add booking, delete booking and edit booking commands, by allowing the list of bookings to be viewable to the user would improve the ease of management of residences for the users.


* **Enhancement**: Tags are placed in a scrollpane
  * What it does: It enables users to scroll through the list of tags that has been added to each residences.
  * Justification: This enhancement improves the product because it allows users to add as many tags as they desire to a residence without the tags pushing other important details of the residence out of visibility.


* **Enhancement**: Color-coding bookings
  * What it does: Introduces 3 colors that highlights the text for booking details: Red for expired bookings, orange for ongoing bookings and green for upcoming bookings.
  * Justification: This enhancement improves the product as it would increase the visibility of the bookings, helping the user to easily differentiate the bookings based on their status which would assists in the management of the residences.


* **Enhancement**: Update Help Window to show all the commands
  * What it does: Provides a list of commands when the user keys in the 'help' function along with instruction on how to use the functions and examples.
  * Justification: This enhancement would improve the user-friendliness of the product for users that are new to the app. It removes the hassle of needing to visit the User Guide when the new user is in the midst being familiarised with the command functions.
