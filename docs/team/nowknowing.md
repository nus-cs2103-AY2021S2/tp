## Project: TutorBuddy

TutorBuddy is a desktop application made for freelance tutors who give one-to-one tuition to efficiently manage their studentsâ€™ contacts,
provide a quick overview of scheduled tuition sessions, and handle monthly tuition fees calculation.
TutorBuddy is also optimized for fast typing users to handle their day-to-day administrative responsibilities effectively.

### Major Enhancements
- Recurring Session component (excluding overlap handling, by Choon Wei)
    - **What it does**: RecurringSession class holds information in addition to Session, namely the interval and last date of recurrence.
    - **Justification**: This feature allows for recurring session, which is likely the norm to tuition sessions, which often occur at fixed intervals.
      Because the information of previously-multiple sessions are now abstracted into one recurring session, this saves resources.
    - **Highlights**:
      Defensive coding employed: A recurring session object can be created only if the last session date is consistent
      with the first session date and interval.<br>
      User-friendly: Through parser of add_rec_session command, the correct last date of a session is suggested if entered wrongly.<br>
      Single responsibility: Creation of recurring session that do not in fact recurse, i.e. happens only once, is prevented.
      This is to establish to users that non-recurring single sessions are not a subset of recurring sessions.<br>
      Some key methods to the recurring session class include:
      - hasSessionOnDate, which checks if recurring session occurs on given date
      - buildSessionOnDate, which returns a single, non-recurring session of the recurring session,
        happening on a valid date
      - lastSessionOnOrBefore, which retrieves the session that would come before a given date.
      - numOfSessionsBetween, which returns the number of sessions that occurs between 2 given dates

      [PR #152](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/152) 
      [PR #258](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/258) <br>
- Delete Session
    - **What it does**: Deletes a session that belongs to a student under his/her list of sessions.
      This includes deleting both a non-recurring session and an entire recurring session.
    - **Justification**: A primitive, necessary  functionality.
    - **Highlights**: Rather basic, the D to CRUD. But not a refactoring of AB3's deletePerson;
    it involves some logic as a session belongs to a list of sessions, belonging to a particular student.
    - **Related PR**: [PR #64](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/64)
    Not merged to master, because pulled to [PR #73](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/73) to combine with storage component for session.

- Non-merged
    - isOverlapDate method for 2 recurring session. Checks in a non-brute-force, mathematical way using extended euclid.
    Reason for no merge: Brute-force method works well in reasonable time. Review can be time-consuming.
