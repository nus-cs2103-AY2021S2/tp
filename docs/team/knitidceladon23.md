## Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter clients by attributes.
    * What it does: allows the user to search for clients using a combination of attributes. The filtered list would include clients with at least one of their attributes matching the search keywords.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will be able to find specific clients with the given attributes, making follow-up actions/commands easier.
    * Highlights: This feature has a similar nature to the find feature in terms of implementation, however the implementation of searches via attributes was tricky since there are different parsing methods to implement for different attributes.
