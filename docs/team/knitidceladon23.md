## Project: Link.me

Link.me is a desktop client management application for insurance agents to manage their contacts. The basic
Link.me codebase is adapted from AddressBook Level 3, an address book app created under the Seedu Initiative. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter clients by attributes.
    * What it does: allows the user to search for clients using a combination of attributes. The filtered list would include clients with at least one of their attributes matching the search keywords.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will be able to find specific clients with the given attributes, making follow-up actions/commands easier.
    * Highlights: This feature has a similar nature to the find feature in terms of implementation, however the implementation of searches via attributes was tricky since there are different parsing methods to implement for different attributes.
