#  Project: A-Bash Book
A-Bash Book (ABB) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Employee and Business Relations Management
System. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written
in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

## Features
* **New feature**: Added autocomplete for commands and command panel
    * What it does: Allows users to toggle through existing commands and autofill them in the command box.
	* Justification: This feature was implemented to aid users in remembering commands and have a faster work flow. As 
	  this product is meant for typists and CLI users.
  	* Highlights: The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key serves as a familiar way to autocomplete and toggle commands.
	* Credits: @yaowei-soc Had helped with the conceptualization and initial implementation of the design.


* **New feature**: Added autocomplete for command flags 
	* What it does: Allows users to toggle through existing flags and autofill them in the command box.
	* Justification: This feature was implemented to allow users to have a faster work flow and selection freedom. This 
	feature minimizes the coginitive load required to memorise flags or end up typing wrong flags.
  	* Highlights: The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key is seamless overloaded with autocomplete commands and can detect when a command
	is complete before suggesting flags.

* **New feature**: Added autocomplete index for `EDIT` and `ADD` commands
	* What it does: Allows the user to use <kb>Up/Down</kb> keys to toggle through the list of contacts and autofill its index.
	* Justification: This feature was implemented to add another layer of keyboard functionality for users to select the index 
	they want to execute a command on.
	* Highlights: This feature aids users in remembering flags for the various commands. This minimizes the number of keys 
	  pressed and saves time.
