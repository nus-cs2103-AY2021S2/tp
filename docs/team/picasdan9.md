## Project: AddressBook Level 3

Vax@NUS is a one stop management app to efficiently track and schedule COVID-19 vaccinations for NUS students. It is a desktop app optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add appointments.
    * What it does: allows the user to add vaccination appointments for NUS students.
    * Justification: This is a key feature of the application to serve the purpose of scheduling vaccination appointments. 
    * Highlights: This feature works hand in hand with the add student feature so that the application can effectively manage student and appointment records.


* **New Feature**: Implemented new GUI
    * What it does: displays student records and appointments side by side.
    * Justification: Users can see student records and appointments at the same time.
    * Highlights: This feature improves usability of the application.
