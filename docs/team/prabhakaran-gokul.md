### The Food Diary Project

#### About the project
- The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

- The Food Diary caters to food-passionate NUS students who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

- The Food Diary will allow students to save time and effort when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity.

#### My Contributions to the project
- **Code Contributed:** [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Prabhakaran-Gokul&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
- **Enhancements implemented:**
    - Add On command
        - This command Allows users to quickly add on parameters like Price and Reviews to existing
          Food Diary Entries.
        - Previously reviews and prices cannot be added to a Food Diary Entry (e.g. KFC) With this add on command,
          users are able to add multiple reviews and a price range easily, without have to delete and add a brand new entry
    - Refactored the Food Diary entries to contain multiple reviews instead of being restricted to a single review
    - Added a price range to the Food Diary entries
