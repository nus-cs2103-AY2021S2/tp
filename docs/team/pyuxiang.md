## Project: PartyPlanet

PartyPlanet is a cross-platform desktop application that helps users plan birthday celebrations.
The user primarily interacts with it using a command-line interface, inside a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java with around 10k LOC.

<br>Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New features

- Add options to search by partial / exact / all / any matches in `list`:
  [\#116](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/116)
  * What it does:
    Allows the user to expand or limit the search criteria when filtering contacts, by specifying whether a partial match
    is desired, and whether all or only one specified criteria should be fulfilled by each filtered contact.
  * Justification:
    The granularity with which users filter contacts can vary greatly depending on their search preferences and
    use case.
  * Highlights:
    Required defining of individual predicates used for filtering, as well as combining these predicates.
    
- Search for contacts by birthday month:
  [\#183](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/183)
  * What it does:
    Allows the user to find groups of contacts matching a birthday month (or with no birthday specified).
  * Justification:
    A major use case involves users planning birthday celebrations on a monthly-basis.
  * Highlights:
    Implemented code to accept months as case-insensitive short / long forms, or as integers.

### Feature enhancements

- Refactor Date class + Add sort by upcoming birthdays (dates) in `list` (`elist`):
  [\#180](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/180)
  * A noticeably big PR, to minimize duplicate functionality using inheritance, and change internal date types
    to better fit subclassing requirements.
- Add option to sort by birthday month in chronological order, and decoupled ordering option from sorting option:
  [\#126](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/126)
- Add alternative date formats (ISO, DMY, YMD) with and without years:
  [\#119](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/119)
  * Justification for chosen formats is partially detailed [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/issues/91#issuecomment-797487476)
- Update email regex to be more permissive:
  [\#286](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/286), issue [\#247](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/issues/247)
- Change prefix syntax to dash form, and add long form alternatives:
  [\#73](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/73),
  [\#111](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/111)
- Improve GUI visuals to accommodate prior font change:
  [\#198](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/198)
  * This is particularly noteworthy since it emphasizes UX design.
- Refactor `theme` command to rely on enumeration, and add theme switching alternative using GUI menu bar:
  [\#184](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/184)
  * Builds upon initial `theme` implementation by `garyljj` in [\#176](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/176)
- Add initial GUI skeleton to display event list:
  commit [`02452dd`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/02452dd58c89a77c79a7f3b2597eb2580a845a65)
  * Implemented in favor of tag list proposed in [\#99](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/99) due to limited horizontal space.
- Add unit tests for:
  [`Date`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/7b886b5b6b9e27971cde42b06a325cb14e64a063),
