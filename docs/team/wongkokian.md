## Project: ClientBook

ClientBook is a desktop application for managing your clientsâ€™ contact details. While it has a GUI created by JavaFX, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to use and store custom shortcuts.
    * What it does: Allows the user to use shortcuts as defined by them. These custom shortcuts can be added, edited, deleted, cleared or listed.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make existing ClientBook commands more personal by assigning more meaningful names to them. This in turn can improve the user's speed/efficiency.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to the existing model.
    * Credits: Structure of shortcut feature was adapted from the AB3 address book and command structures.

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Modified `find` to allow the user to find contacts by fields other than name (Pull request [\#44](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/44))
    * Removed `clear` after the addition of `batch` commands (Pull request [\#104](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/104))

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
