## Project: CoLAB

CoLAB (Collaboration Lab) is a desktop app for university students to manage their school projects. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to manage groupmates (`addG`, `updateG`, `deleteG` commands) (Pull requests [\#82](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/82), [\#108](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/108), [\#206](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/206), [\#214](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/214)).
  * What it does: Adds a list of groupmates to each project, allows the user to create, read, update and delete groupmates with commands.
  * Justification: This feature is the main "colab" feature of CoLAB. It allows the user to manage group projects more easily.
  * Credits: original [AB3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/tp) authors.
