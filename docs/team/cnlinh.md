## Project: SunRez

SunRez is a desktop resident management application used for managing NUS hostels and residential colleges. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added support for user-defined aliases ([#65](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/pull/65))
  * What it does: The `alias` command adds a user-defined shortcut for a longer command, allowing the (typically shorter) alias to be used in place of the actual command.
  * Justification: Enhances the user's CLI experience, especially for advanced users, as users can define shorter and more concise aliases that are more intuitive to them. Makes the execution of commands more flexible.
  * Highlights: This feature involves a heavy refactoring of the way commands are parsed. Multiple iterations and design alternative considerations were needed. It was also tested comprehensively to handle several edge-cases (such as when the user tries to define a recursive alias). 
  * Credits: Initial design was adapted from https://github.com/briyanii/main.
