## Project: A-Bash Book

A-Bash Book (ABB) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Employee and Business Relations Management
System. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written
in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an `email` command that allows the user to email contacts using the
  operating system's email client
    * What it does: allows the user to email one or many contacts via the operating system's email
      client.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can be able to
      mass email contacts if needed such as a broadcast message.
    * Highlights: This command makes use of the 'mailto' URI
      scheme [RFC 6068](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6068) to open the email client. However,
      Outlook for Windows does not support commas as a delimiter by default which requires the user
      to tweak their configuration before getting this feature to work.
    * Credits: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/16615384/3903483> for the idea of using JavaFX host
      services to open the 'mailto' link.

* **New Feature**: Added a `select` command that allows the user to select multiple contacts to
  modify.
    * What it does: Allows the user to select multiple contacts to modify. Similar to how checkboxes
      are used in the web browser.
    * Justification: Enables the user to quickly perform modifications to contacts without having to
      explicitly remembering the index number.
    * Highlights: This feature affects multiple components (UI, Model, Logic) and thus designing the
      solution must ensure that original design patterns and abstractions must not be violated.

* **Enhanced Feature**: Enhance `edit` and `delete` features to work with select feature and
  multiple indexes.
    * What it does: Allows the user to select multiple contacts then act on it using `edit`
      and `delete`.
    * Justification: Enables the user to quickly perform modifications to multiple contacts and
      without having to explicitly remembering the index number.
    * Highlights: This feature affects how indexes are parsed and to take into account the selected
      contacts.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=yaowei-soc)
  
* **Project management**:
    * Managed milestones and tagging issues or pull requests to milestones.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Enhanced `edit`, `delete` command to be used with `select`
      command. [\#129](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/129)
