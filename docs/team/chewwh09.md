## Project: StoreMando

StoreMando is a **desktop app for managing inventory, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, StoreMando can get your inventory
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
