## Project: Green Mileage Efforts

GreenMileageEfforts (GME) is a platform that helps drivers and passengers of any IT company quickly arrange carpooling in order to lower their carbon footprint. The platform follows that of a command-line interface (CLI) such that power users that are familiar can efficiently navigate the program.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
