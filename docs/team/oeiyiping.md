## Features
* **New feature**: Changed the command syntax from eg. `x/` to `-x` to follow the format of Bash syntax.
	* Function: Adapts Bash command syntax for user input.
	* Purpose: The change is necessary because being syntactically similar to Bash is a core advertised feature of ABB, as this allows seasoned Bash users to immediately start using ABB without any learning curve.


* **New feature**: Added ability to add remark to any contact.
	* Function: Allows users to add any comment they have regarding the selected contact.
	* The purpose is to allow users to add any information (that the other contact fields do not address)  relevant to the selected contact.

* **New feature**: Built-in Help menu.
	* What it does: Allows the user to view the help information directly from within the ABB application, without having to copy/paste the provided URL to access the user guide online. The help information is in the form of a command summary (`command name `|`command format`).
	* Justification: Allows users to access help information without  internet access.
