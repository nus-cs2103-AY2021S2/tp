## Project: Residence Tracker

ResidenceTracker (RT) is a **desktop app for managing residences, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RT can get your residence management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Edit Booking.
  * What it does: allows user to edit the details of an existing booking.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product since bookings are always subjected to changes such as postponements, additional day of booking, late estimated arrivals, etc. By
  allowing the user to edit the details the of the bookings, it helps to smoothen the process of updating information. 

* **New Feature**: Delete Booking
   * What it does: allows user to delete an existing booking.
   * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing the user to delete bookings that are expired, or cancelled so that the bookings column will not be cluttered with nonessential information.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=awzhenyi&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=awzhenyi&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103-T16-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
