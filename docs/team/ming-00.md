## Project: BookCoin

BookCoin is a CLI facility management system which allows users to manage bookings through a CLI interface and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `add_venue` command and refactored it during iterations to include features that enhance usability.
    * What it does: allows the user to add venues one at a time into the system through a multi step command with optional fields such as capacity, description, tags.

* **New Feature**: Refactored other Venue commands when new fields are added into Venue class
