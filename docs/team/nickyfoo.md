## Project: PartyPlanet

PartyPlanet is a cross-platform desktop application that helps users plan birthday celebrations.
The user primarily interacts with it using a command-line interface, inside a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java with around 10k LOC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New features

- Added feature to undo/redo previous commands.
  [\#107](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/107)
  [\#189](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/189)
  * What it does: Allows the user to `undo` previous commands (which change the state of the address book/event book). Prior undo commands can be redone with `redo`
  * Justification: A user could make mistakes when writing/using commands, especially since we condensed the available commands to the essentials. As such, PartyPlanet should provide an easily available way to undo this. Keyboard shortcuts were also implemented.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required the creation of a `StateHistory` class to track the `State` of the address and event books at the same time.
  * Credits: Code used is referenced weakly from the [AB4 `undo` and `redo`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands), but they differ significantly as `StateHistory` has to be customized for PartyPlanet.

- Added event book and feature to add events (`eadd` command)
  commits [4408fd8](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/4408fd8d35d6b7316c1df697fe85b66798235ad8), [858ae4a](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/858ae4a90277abeebc7681eddd9fe0739e2727c5), [551afbd](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/551afbd4839195fde395d29ff86ef197637c0da8), [9394207](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/93942076dd8d51785c33e835dd3ac217c81a6344)
  * What it does: Allows the user to store a book of events in PartyPlanet, and to `eadd` an event to PartyPlanet
  * Justification: A user would want to keep track of upcoming celebrations, or celebrations that need to be planned.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affected the existing `Logic` and `Model`, and required implementation and integration of `EventBook` and `Event` from scratch. Finally, testing stubs had to be updated to reflect changes.
  * Credits: Code used for `eadd` is referenced from the `add` command, and `EventBook` and `Event` are based off of `AddressBook` and `Person`. 
 
- Added feature to request help for specific commands (`help COMMAND`):
  [\#74](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/74)
  * What it does: Allows the user to request help for a specific command with an optional parameter `COMMAND`, to be displayed directly in the UI, instead of redirecting to the UG.
  * Justification: Our command syntax is dense, with many optional parameters. `help` gives a brief overview of all available commands with syntax, and the user can specify a command to get detailed help on, directly available in the UI. This speeds up workflow and minimizes cross referencing to resources outside the application.
  * Highlights: This enhancement relies heavily on `MESSAGE_USAGE_CONCISE` and `MESSAGE_USAGE` in each individual command.
  * Credits: Code used is based on the AB3 `help` command, but then significantly modified after.

### Feature enhancements

  [\#145](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/145)
- Refactored DETAIL to REMARK and repackaged and reorganized `Name` and `Remark` classes:
  [\#311](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/311)
