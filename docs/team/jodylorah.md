## Project: insurance Sure Can Arrange Meeting (iScam)

iScam is a desktop location book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 18 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store meeting data into a JSON file.
    * What it does: allows the user to store meeting objects as a JSON file into a local storage.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can store and retrieve past added meetings.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects all instances of meeting commands since past saved meetings can be easily retrieved, updated and amended. It makes iScam more feasible to use since meetings are saved. It even comes with test cases to ensure extend code coverage.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jodylorah&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByAuthors&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=JodyLorah&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
