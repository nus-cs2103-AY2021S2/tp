# Welcome to Focuris User Guide!

Focuris is a **desktop application** for **managing events** with a KanBan board, which is a board where your **events displayed according to the level of completion** of each event, which consists of Backlog, Todo, In-Progress and Done.

## Here's why you should use Focuris:

- Focuris is made specially for **university students** like you to keep track of your tasks to complete.
- Use of a Command Line Interface (CLI) allows fast typists to manage your event boards faster than applications with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- Gain ability to prioritize your tasks by looking at their priority level, from **Low** to **High**.
- Get instant overview on the level of completion of each of your tasks.

   - **`log`**`n/CS2107 Finals d/Finals on 3rd May 2021` : Adds an event named `CS2107 Finals` to the application with status `BACKLOG`.

   - **`prog`**`n/CS2100 d/Lab` : Adds an event named `CS2100` to the application with status `IN PROGRESS`.

   - **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the event with the identifier of 3 shown on the KanBan board.

   - **`exit`** : Exits the application.

# 2. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#parameters) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION`, `NAME` is a [parameter](#parameters) which can be used as `todo n/CS2030`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `n/CS2030 d/Assignement p/HIGH` or as `n/CS2030 d/Assignment`.

- [Parameters](#parameters) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- If a [parameter](#parameters) is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the [parameter](#parameters) will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `d/walk d/run`, only `d/run` will be taken.

- Extraneous [parameters](#parameters) for commands that do not take in [parameters](#parameters) (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## 3. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Focuris home folder.

**Q**: Does this application require an Internet connection?<br>
**A**: No, Focuris does not require an Internet connection to use.

**Q**: What is the maximum length of text I can enter into a event name or event description?<br>
**A**: Focuris does not limit the maximum length of text that can be entered and stored as it will increase the size 
of the card to fit the text given. However, the general notion we try to promote is **efficiency** and **productivity**,
 and thus we recommend keeping the text under **20 characters** for the event name, and **40 characters** for the description.

**Q**: Will my data be sent anywhere else or shared with third parties?<br>
**A**: Your data is stored locally on your own computer. Focuris does not use any Internet connection so no data can be 
sent to any online servers.
