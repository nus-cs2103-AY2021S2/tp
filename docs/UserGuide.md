## **1. Introduction**

<div align="center">

</div>

Welcome and thank you for downloading **CoLAB**! Are you a university student in search of a reliable app to keep track of your school projects? Do you struggle to keep track of the many tasks and deadlines for various school projects? Do you also tend to forget the various group meetings you have scheduled? You have come to the right place!

CoLAB (Collaboration Lab) is a **desktop app for university students to manage their school projects.**  CoLAB's main features include:

* Project management
* Contact management
* Today View that surfaces an overview of upcoming events and deadlines

With CoLAB, you can efficiently manage all your school projects through our comprehensive project management tools.

We have designed a user-friendly User Interface (UI) that is intuitive to both first-time users and seasoned ones. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a clean and inviting Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CoLAB can get your project management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

We look forward to seeing what you accomplish with CoLAB. Get your journey started with the [Quick Start section](#3-quick-start)!

You can also easily sift through CoLAB's various commands and features by referring to the Table of Contents at the beginning of this User Guide.

### **2.2 Reading This Document**

This subsection serves to provide explanations on the application's user interface (UI) as well as symbols, syntax and technical terms used throughout this User Guide. Familiarising yourself with this subsection will make the User Guide easier to read.

#### **2.2.1 Special Formats**

Formats discussed in this section may be used in relevant areas of this user guide.

**Tips**

Messages that appear in a tip box are useful for improving your experience with CoLAB.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Example tip!
</div>

**Warnings**

Messages that appear in a warning box are important to follow as unintended consequences may follow otherwise.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Example warning!
</div>

**Additional Information**

Messages that appear in an information box are additional information that may be useful to know.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
Example information!
</div>

**Highlights**

Words or sentences that appear in these highlighted boxes are being emphasized for their relevance in that section.

`Example highlight!`

#### **2.2.2 Sections of the Application Window**

Different sections of the application window will be referred to by the names described in the image shown below:

![App Window Sections Main](images/app_window_section_main.png)

#### **2.2.3 Navigating the UI**

Although most of the buttons you see on the screen are clickable, the UI has been designed primarily to be navigated using the command line interface.

Users can enter commands into the command box and press `ENTER` to execute them. The result box will be updated with information on whether the command has been successfully executed. Depending on the command executed, the main panel may also be updated based on the command executed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Most commands require all the parameters (e.g. project index and deadline index when updating a deadline) so that you can run the command from anywhere within the app.
</div>

When entering a command, you may find it helpful to see a history of your previous commands. To do so simply press `UP` or `DOWN` while typing to navigate through the command history list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
Only successfully executed commands will be saved.
</div>

#### **2.2.4 Command Format**

Commands discussed in this user guide follow these rules:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addC n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter that can be used as `addC n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order. This excludes a parameter without a prefix, which must be the first parameter when required.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `PROJECT_INDEX i/TODO_INDEX d/DESCRIPTION`, `i/TODO_INDEX d/DESCRIPTION PROJECT_INDEX` is **not**  acceptable as `PROJECT_INDEX` is a parameter without a prefix and should be the first parameter.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**

* If a parameter is expected only once in a command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Commands that do not take in extra parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will ignore the additional parameters that are appended to it.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If a command expects a specific set of parameters, another parameter with an unrecognised prefix would be assumed to be part of the previous parameters input and not as another parameter.<br>
  e.g. if a command expects these parameters `addP n/CS2103` and instead you enter `addP n/CS2103 p/56785678`, the application would assume your input to `n/` to be `CS2103 p/56785678`, which may not be valid for certain commands.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Parameters refer to information that is to be included as an input to a command.
</div>

#### **2.2.5 Command Parameters**

This subsection serves to list out the parameters used in this document.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
To achieve the best possible experience, avoid adding excessively long text to CoLAB. At small screen resolutions and with unusually long parameters, text may be truncated to  fit in the main panel. While we do not expect such occurrences to happen in day-to-day regular use, we have made accommodations for it. To view the rest of the truncated text, simply hover over the relevant section and scroll sideways, either with a trackpad or shift-scroll if you are using a mouse with a scroll wheel.

### **4.1 Projects**

Each project in CoLAB contains information about todos, deadlines, events and groupmates to help you keep track of everything you need to effectively manage the project.

![App Window Sections Projects](images/app_window_section_projects.png)

You may view a list of all your projects in the side panel and view a specific project in the main panel using the `project` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**

## **5. FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CoLAB home folder.

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: CoLAB's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q**: Are my contacts and project groupmates linked?<br>
**A**: No, currently there is no link between contacts and groupmates. This is a feature that we plan to add in future versions of CoLAB. However, you may still add a contact with the contact details of the groupmate. Once the contact has been added, you can then easily find the contact by using the `findC` command to search for their name.

**Q**: Can I edit the data files directly?<br>
**A**: CoLAB's data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/colab.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, CoLAB will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
