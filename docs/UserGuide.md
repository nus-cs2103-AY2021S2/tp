## Introduction

_**Tutor Tracker**_ is a **desktop app designed to help secondary school students manage tutors and tuition appointments, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) for a fast and streamlined experience while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Tutor Tracker can get your tuition contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `tutortracker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorTracker.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

This section contains all the information about the features of Tutor Tracker. You may enter a command into the Command Box to use each feature or sub-feature.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_tutor n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_tutor n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [l/LOCATION]` can be used as `n/John Doe l/Clementi` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[l/LOCATION]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `l/Bedok`.

* Items that have date as a parameter must strictly follow `YYYY-MM-DD` format.<br> 
  e.g. `2021-03-01`and `2021-04-20`.

* Items that have time as a parameter must strictly follow `HH:MM AM/PM` format.<br>
  e.g. `9:01 AM` and `10:30 PM`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/SUBJECT`, `s/SUBJECT n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `l/Bedok l/Clementi`, only `l/Clementi` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Parameters in angle brackets (`<`, `>`) must be supplied together as a group. eg. with `<s/SUBJECT_NAME r/RATE>`, both subject name and rate must be supplied.
