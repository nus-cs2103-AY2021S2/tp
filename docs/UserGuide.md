Are you finding it difficult to keep track of your insurance clients? Life as an insurance agent isn't easy. We
understand. Link.me is a **desktop app built for insurance agents** to help you manage your clients. Features of
Link.me include adding, editing, deleting, searching for and filtering clients. Link.me also supports peripheral
features such as adding and removing insurance plans of clients, meeting scheduling, recording client notes and
notifying the user of important upcoming events.

Link.me is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical
User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Link.me can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional
GUI apps.

### Using this guide

This user guide will guide you, as an insurance agent, through the process of setting up Link.me, introduce you to the
capabilities of Link.me and facilitate your usage of Link.me so that you can better manage your ever-increasing
number of clients.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `linkme.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for `Link.me`. We recommend you create a new folder for this.

4. Double-click the file to start `Link.me`. A window similar to the one shown below should appear in a few seconds.
   Note how Link.me already contains some sample data. You may look through the sample data to get an idea of what
   client information Link.me will store.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open
   the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

      * **`list`** : Lists all of your clients.
    
      * **`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 John Street g/M b/1993-05-06`** : Adds a client named `John Doe` to Link.me.
    
      * **`delete 3`** : Deletes the 3rd client shown in the currently displayed client list.
    
      * **`clear`** : Deletes all of your clients. You may use this to clear the sample data.
    
      * **`exit`** : Exits Link.me.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

### Layout

The structure of the Link.me interface is split into five main parts:
![Layout](images/Layout.png)
* The **Input Command Line** is where you input commands for execution.

* The **Result Display** displays the result of your command.

* The **Client List** displays the list of clients you have stored in Link.me.

* The **Meeting List** displays the list of meetings that you have scheduled.

* The **Status Bar** displays information regarding where your information is stored (not relevant for basic users).

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs you should supply.<br>
  e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` represents the client's name that you should provide. For instance, if the
  client's name is "John Doe", you should input: `n/John Doe`.


* Inputs in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. in `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, while the input for `n/NAME` is mandatory, it is okay to omit `[t/TAG]`.
  For instance, these two inputs are valid:
  * `n/John Doe t/medical`
  * `n/John Doe`


* Inputs with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. in `[t/TAG]…​`, the following inputs are valid:
  * `t/medical`
  * `t/medical t/investment`

* You can enter your inputs in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* If an input is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the
  input will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.


* For commands that do not take in additional inputs (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), any additional inputs will
  be ignored.<br>
  e.g. for the `help` command, if you input `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.


</div>

  </div>
  <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
  :bulb: **Tip:** Link.me does not allow identical names to help you avoid confusion. If more than one of your

      to help you differentiate them.
  </div>

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** Meetings with clashes will not be scheduled, but Link.me only detects clashes when the scheduled time 
is exactly the same. Even with a difference of 1 minute, Link.me will schedule a new meeting. This is to give you
 the largest flexibility when using Link.me.
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** You cannot schedule meetings in the past.
</div>

Example:

* `schedule 2 m/Insurance Plan @ 2023-10-28 14:30` schedules a meeting with description "Insurance Plan" with the 2nd client

</div>

Example:

* `unschedule 2` removes the 2nd meeting on the meeting list.

### Searching for clients

#### Finding clients by name: `find`

You can find clients by simply entering their name. If you wish to filter clients by specific attributes
such as gender, age, insurance plan name, etc, refer to [Filtering clients by attributes](#filtering-clients-by-attributes--filter) below.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`
  , `Bo Yang`

Examples: (Please refer to the sample data for this.)

* `find John` returns `John Doe`
* `find Alex Jeff` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `Jeff Liu`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex jeff'](images/findAlexJeffResult.png)

#### Filtering clients by attributes : `filter`

You can filter clients by their address, gender, tags, age or insurance plan name.

Format: `filter PREFIX/KEYWORD [PREFIX/MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

Supported `PREFIX/KEYWORD` pairs:
* address: `a/ADDRESS`
* gender: `g/GENDER` (`GENDER` should be either `M`/`Male`, `F`/`Female` or `N`/`Non-binary`)
* tag: `t/TAG`
* age: `age/[AGE]` or `age/[AGE_LOWER_BOUND]-[AGE_HIGHER_BOUND]` (Age should be a non-negative integer)
* insurance plan name: `i/PLAN_NAME`

Note:
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. for gender, `male` will match `Male`
* Clients with attributes matching all of the keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). e.g.
  `g/F age/40` will return all clients that are female AND are aged 40.

Example:

* `filter a/Clementi g/M t/medical i/Protecc age/23-30` returns:

  * clients who have "Clementi" in their address, and
  * clients who are Male, and
  * clients with the "medical" tag, and
  * clients with the insurance plan "Protecc", and
  * clients aged between 23 and 30 years old, inclusive

### Displaying notifications : `notif`

You can view a notification window containing:
* All meetings occurring today, arranged in order of time.
* All client birthdays within the next two weeks, arranged in order of time.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** This notification window is also shown when starting up Link.me.
</div>

### Saving the data

Link.me data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that modifies existing data. There is no need to
save manually.

#### Editing the data file

Link.me data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/linkme.json`. We encourage only advanced users to edit
the JSON file directly. The Link.me team does not take any responsibility in data loss or startup failures following
invalid inputs.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, Link.me will try to discard all data and start with an empty 
data file at the next run. However, if the damage is too excessive, Link.me may be unable to start up.
In the case that this happens, please manually delete the data file in order to start the app successfully.
</div>
