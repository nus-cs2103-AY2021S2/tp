```
component command prefix/[INPUT] -flag
```

- `component` - Component to apply the command to. (e.g. `customer`, `menu`)  
  
- `command` - Command to run. (e.g. `list`, `add`)  
  
- `prefix/[INPUT]` - Item in `[ ]` are the input to be supplied by the user. (e.g. `n/Thomas`)  
  
- `-flag` - change behavior. (e.g. `-f`, `-a`)
  
>   <b><u>Things to note</u></b>  
>   - Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
>   Example:
>       ```
>       menu add n/[NAME] p/[PRICE] i/[INGREDIENT_ID]... q/[INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]...
>       ```
>       `i/[INGREDIENT_ID]... q/[INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times) or `i/2 q/3 i/3 q/4`.
>   <p>&nbsp;</p>
>
>   - Item in round brackets are optional.<br>
>   Example:
>       ```
>       customer add n/[NAME] (t/[TAG])
>       ```
>       `n/[NAME] (t/[TAG])` can be used as `n/Thomas t/Friend` or as `n/Thomas Tan`
>   <p>&nbsp;</p>
>
>   - Only one command can be executed at a time and any words after a valid command is entered will be ignored.  
>   Example:
>       ```

        Format:

         The above command would list all the customers in the left column of the GUI[<sup>3</sup>](#glossary) in the sequence that they were added, with the most recent being at the top.

        Example:

         a/21 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119077 t/Gluten Allergy
         ```

        The above command would add a new customer named "Alan Tan" with phone number 81236789, email address "alantan@nus.edu.sg",
        address "Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119077" and tagged with "Gluten Allergy".
        > Note: A known limitation of add is that customers with different names but exactly the same details (phone number, email, address) will not be marked as a duplicate.

        Format:
        ```
        customer delete [INDEX] (-f)
        ```

        In the event that there are uncompleted orders by the customer that is being attempted to be deleted, a `-f` flag has to be added to the end of the command to confirm the command. This is to prevent you from accidentally deleting orders unknowingly and leading to unhappy customers!

        Examples:
        ```
        customer delete 2
        ```

        The above command would delete the second customer on the customer information pane named "Bernice Yu".

        ```
        customer delete 2 -f
        ```

        In the event that there are pending orders that have not been fulfilled that belong to customer 2, then deletion of the customer will not be allowed since we do not want to unknowingly delete orders that are still pending.
        If deleting all orders, even pending ones, is desired, then adding the `-f` at the end of the command acknowledges and confirms the deletion behavior. Orders associated with the customer will be deleted and will no longer be shown in the order list or order history.

        ![JJIMY Customer Pane](images/jjimy-main.png)
        Using the above screenshot as an example, `customer delete 2` would delete "Bernice Yu" from the customers list. However, we can see on the right that there is an outstanding order that has not been completed that belong to her.
        Hence, if you are sure you want to delete her details, the command would be `customer delete 2 -f` instead. Upon deletion, the order that previously belonged to her will also be deleted from the application as well.

        customer edit [INDEX] (n/[NAME]) (p/[PHONE]) (e/[EMAIL]) (a/[ADDRESS]) (t/[TAG])
        ```

        At least one of the fields in brackets must be present in the edit command.

        Examples:

        ```
        customer edit 2 n/George Tan
        ```

        The above command changes the name of the second customer on the customers pane from "Bernice Yu" to "George Tan".

        ```
        customer edit 2 n/George Tan p/80009999
        ```

        The above command changes both the name and phone number of the second customer.

        From the examples above, more than one field can be edited at a time but at least 1 field must be specified for it to be a valid command.

        - `n/` - Finds all customers whose names contain any of the keywords (case-insensitive). Keywords are space separated.

        The result list from find persists even if other commands are called and is only reset when `customer list` is called again.
        Any index that accesses `customer` will reference from this result list.        
      
        Example:
        ```
        customer find n/George Michael Lim
        ```

        The above command would display all customers with names that contain either "George", "Michael", or "Lim". Note that at least 1 keyword must be specified, `customer find n/Thomas` is a valid command too with only 1 keyword ("Thomas").

        menu list (-a)
        ```
        To list the current available dishes only, a `-a` flag has to be added to the end of the command. The above command would list all the available/all dishes in the right column of  the GUI[<sup>3</sup>](#glossary) in the sequence that they were added, with the most recent being at the top.
        Examples:
        ```
        menu list

        The above command would display all dishes disregard the availability of the dish.

        ```
        menu list -a
        ```
        The above command will only display the dishes that are currently available based on the available ingredients.

        ```

        In the event that there are uncompleted orders by the dishes that is being attempted to be deleted, a `-f` flag
        has to be added to the end of the command to confirm the command. This is to prevent you from accidentally
        deleting orders unknowingly and leading to unhappy customers!

        Examples:
        ```
        menu delete 2

        The above command would delete the second dishes on the menu information pane.

        ```
        menu delete 2 -f
        ```

        In the event that there are pending orders that have not been fulfilled that contains dish id 2, then deletion
        of the dish will not be allowed since we do not want to unknowingly delete orders that are still pending.
        If deleting any dishes that belongs to any uncompleted order and cancelling those orders is desired, then adding 
        the `-f` at the end of the command acknowledges this behavior. Orders associated with the menu dish will 
        be marked as cancelled and will no longer be shown in the order list but can be viewed in the order history.
        
        For example, if there is an outstanding order that contains the dish "Burger", we will need to use `menu delete 2 -f`
        to delete the dish. Upon deletion, the order that contained "Burger" will be marked as cancelled.

        > Note: you cannot edit a dish if it results in the uncomplete orders being unable to be completed! For example, if there is one order for "Chicken Wings" and one serving of it requires 1 "chicken" and there is only 1 chicken left in the inventory, then editing the dish "Chicken Wings" from requiring 1 "chicken" to 2 "chicken" will not be permitted because the inventory does not have enough stock left to fulfil the order!

        Any index that accesses `order` will reference from this result list.

        Example:
        ```
        order find n/Alex Sally d/Fried rice
        ```
        Finds orders made by Alex or Sally that have fried rice in them.

        Format:

        inventory delete [INDEX] (-f)
        ```

        In the event that there are ingredients that is needed by certain dishes that is being attempted to be deleted,
        a `-f` flag has to be added to the end of the command to confirm the command. This is to prevent you from
        accidentally deleting dishes unknowingly and leads to invalid orders! Orders that use the dishes will hence be cancelled!

        Examples:
        ```
        inventory delete 2
        ```

        The above command would delete the second ingredient on the inventory information pane.

        ```
        inventory delete 2 -f
        ```

        In the event that there are dishes that needs ingredient id 2, then deletion
        of the dish will not be allowed since we do not want to unknowingly delete dishes that needs the ingredient.
        If deleting any ingredient that is needed to any dishes is desired, then adding the `-f` at the
        end of the command acknowledges and confirms the deletion behavior. 
        Orders associated with the ingredient will be marked as cancelled and will no longer be shown in the order list but can be viewed in the order history.

        ![JJIMY Inventory Pane](images/InventoryForceDelete1.png)
        Using the above screenshot as an example, `inventory delete 1` would delete "Potato" from the inventory. 
        However, we can see in the middle that "French Fries" uses "Potato" as ingredient.
        At the same time, David Li has an outstanding order of "French Fries" as well.
      
        An error will be shown as below when `inventory delete 1` is entered.
        ![JJIMY Inventory Pane](images/InventoryForceDelete2.png)
      
        Hence, if you are sure you want to delete the ingredient, the command would be `inventory delete 2 -f` instead. 
        Upon deletion, the dish that previously uses "Potato as ingredient" will be deleted as well as the order contains
        that particular dish will be marked as cancelled.
