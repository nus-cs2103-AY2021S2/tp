# Welcome to Car@leads
Car@leads is a **desktop app for a car salesperson to manage customer contacts** (CLI).
<br> Users can add new customer contacts which include details such as customer's car brand and car type preferences along with other personal information.
<br> Users can filter through the customer data using specific filters, such as filtering out customers who prefer a specific car brand and follow up with them for sales opportunities.
<br> Car@leads is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
<br> If you can type fast, Car@leads can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `COE_EXPIRY_DATE` input order: YYYY{space}MM{space}DD
  * Example: `2013 12 31`
  * This is the same input format as `DATE_OF_BIRTH`
* `|` joins car with COE expiry date
* `+` joins car brand and car type

</div>

### Adding a customer: `add`

Adds a customer to the contact list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS b/DATE_OF_BIRTH [t/TAG]…​ [c/CAR_BRAND_OWNED+CAR_TYPE_OWNED|COE_EXPIRY_DATE] [cp/CAR_BRAND_PREFERRED+CAR_TYPE_PREFERRED]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A customer can have any number of tags, carsOwned, carPreferred (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Wayne p/88765432 e/bobhnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/1998 07 10`
* `add n/Bob Ang p/88765432 e/bobhnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/1998 07 10  t/friend c/BMW+Coupe|2030 01 01 c/Porsche+SUV|2030 01 01 cp/MercedesBenz+SUV`
### Finding a customer: `find` 

Find customers from the contact list that matches specified filters.

Format: `find  [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS] [c/OWNED_CARBRAND+OWNED_CARTYPE] [coe/COE_EXPIRY_DATE] [t/TAGs] 
[cp/PREFERRED_CARBRAND+PREFERRED_CARTYPE] [b/DATE_OF_BIRTH]`

**IMP** : All arguments are optional. In particular:
- for `c/OWNED_CARBRAND+OWNED_CARTYPE`, user can either give brand or type information, or both using the `+`sign to 
  separate.
  
- for `cp/PREFERRED_CARBRAND+PREFERRED_CARTYPE` user can either give brand or type information, or both using the 
  `+` sign to separate.
  
- for `n/NAME` giving a partial name is also okay - all names which have the given parameter as a subsequence (Note 
  that `abc` is a subsequence of `addbddc`) will be matched. Note that this is the only field for which we match 
  a subsequence instead of a simple substring.
  
- for `e/EMAIL`, all email containing the given parameter will be valid, but note that domain name is not checked.
    - eg `find e/abc` will return profiles with the following emails:
        -  `abcd@gmail.com`
        -  `bbabc@gmail.com`
    - It will _not_ return:
        - `xxx@abc.com`
        - `axbyc@hhh.com`


Further details about the search options are as follows:

- For `coe/COE_EXPIRY_DATE`, using `coe/exp` will search for all customers with an expired COE on any of the cars they own.
  it is a special case alias for the search `coe/0`, where `coe/NON_NEGATIVE_NUMBER` will search for any customers with
  at least one car that will expire in `NON_NEGATIVE_NUMBER` years *or less*.
  
- for `a/ADDRESS` partial addresses are also acceptable

- for `b/DATE_OF_BIRTH` partial dates also work. Note that `find b/1999` is a more generic search than `find b/1999 
  02` and hence will return more items.
  
- for `t/TAGS` all customers satisfying _any_ tag will be returned. In particular, `find t/TAG_A TAG_B TAG_C` is a more 
  generic 
  query than `find t/TAG_A` 
  

**COMBINING FIND PARAMETERS**

We can combine in the following way : 
-   `find a/Orchard /AND n/John /AND /NOT t/CRIMINAL`
-   `find a/Orchard /AND n/John /AND [ t/RICH /OR /NOT t/CRIMINAL ]`

Note that for `find A /AND B /OR C /OR D /AND E` , the implicit bracketing considered is `find A /AND [B /OR [C /OR [D 
/AND E]]]`

## Deleting a customer : `delete`

Deletes the specified customer from the contact list.

Format: `delete name`

* Deletes the customer with the specified `name`.
* The name refers to the customer name shown in the displayed customer contact list.
* The name **must be valid** does not contain special characters  …​

## Listing all customers : `list`

Shows a list of all customers in the system

Format: `list`

## Clear all customers : `clear`
* **`clear`** : Deletes all customers in the system.

## Repeat last Command : `/up`
* **`/up{X}`** : Loads in the previous command. `{X}` can be any string of characters, usually the previous command.
* Examples: `/updelete John Doe`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
There does not need to be a space after /up, so long as it is the first part of the 'command'
</div>

eg: The command Box is as follows

    - find e/Apple
    - find e/AppleChain
    - /up
    - /up
Result:  
    - `find e/Apple`

  as it is on a different server.
  ![Ui](images/helps/googleHelp4.png)
  
  
  If you face any difficulty enabling access, please follow through below guide, or check out the help window for steps
  in setting up.
  1. Go to google security(URL: https://myaccount.google.com/security)
  ![Ui](images/helps/googleHelp1.png)
  2. Scroll down or use the search function and type in 'Less secure app access' without quotation marks.
  ![Ui](images/helps/googleHelp2.png)
  3. Turn on the feature and this grants application access to only the Mail sending server. This feature disables the 
  feature for 2-Step Authentication. 
  ![Ui](images/helps/googleHelp3.png)  
     
  After set up:
  You will be required to fill in the respective fields, please note that current version does not support multiple 
  authentication attempts, hence you will be required to restart the application if your email or password details are
  filled incorrectly.
  ![Ui](images/helps/emailLogin.png)
  
  
  **Successful Login**
  You will receive a confirmation message 'Message Sent' when email is successfully sent out. 
  Please note that in this we have blocked multiple log in and authentication, the email and password box will be disabled 
  after successful authentication. If you have been successfully authenticated, a green text will be shown in the bottom 
  left corner of the interface 'You are logged in'.
  You may continue to send email to other receiver addresses without having to re-enter the password.
  ![Ui](images/helps/Sentmail.png)
  
 
  Please note that if you input a non-existing receiver email, message will still mark as sent. You will however receive a 
  sending fail message at your gmail inbox, but since this application does not have access to this information, we
  are unable to check validity of email.
  ![Ui](images/helps/LoginSuccWrongToemail.png)

  Please note that this version does not support identification of invalid domain name, but only absence of domain. Hence
  your email will still be mark as sent. However you will be receiving a failed message in your email inbox.
  ![Ui](images/helps/invalidDomain.png)

  **Failed Login**

  If you have failed the authentication, either due to mismatching email and password, you will be required to restart
  the application, as support for multiple logins are blocked. The password you entered will be cleared, together with the
