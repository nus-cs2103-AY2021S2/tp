## Description

The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The Food Diary caters to food-passionate NUS students who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

The Food Diary will allow students to save time and effort when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity. The Food Diary especially caters to students mainly on 4 aspects:

1. The ability for users to save food diary entries for future reference.
2. The ability for users to find entries based on specific fields.
3. The ability for users to have multiple food reviews for a food place.
4. The option for users to use Commands / UI to perform some tasks quickly.
