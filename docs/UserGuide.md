* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>

that contains the data of your previous WeebLingo home folder.

**Q**: Can I add my customized flashcards?</br>
**A**: Sorry, the current version of the application does not allow self-defined flashcards to be added. However, if you
are advanced and you know how to manipulate the storage files, you can do so if you want.
