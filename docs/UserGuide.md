</div>

#### 4.2.1 Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

This section details the format of the commands available in TutorBuddy. We will adhere to the following:


* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters / information to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_student n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `find_student KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `find_student John Samuel` or as `find_student John`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/STUDENT_PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/STUDENT_PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/98765432 p/99999999`, only `p/99999999` will be taken.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `emails`, `help`, `exit`, `clear` and `list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Names are case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. `john` is considered different from `John`. <br>
  However, note that in [`find_student`](#locating-student-by-name-find_student), the search is case-insensitive.

* Names cannot be duplicates.<br>
  e.g. There cannot be 2 different students of the same name `John Tan` and `John Tan`.
  
* Indexes must be positive whole numbers 1, 2, 3, â€¦

* The `STUDENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the [displayed student list](#application-overview).

* The `SESSION_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the [displayed session list](#application-overview).

* Time must be input in the format, `hh:mm`.
  e.g. `13:00` is allowed, but not `1300`.

* Date must be input in the format, `yyyy-mm-dd`.
  e.g. `2021-01-01` is allowed, but not `01-01-2021`.
  
* Year must be between 1970 and 2037, both inclusive, in consideration of the
  [2038 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem)
  e.g. `1969` and `2038` is not allowed.

</ol>

![edit_student_result_example](images/enhao/edit_student_result%20-%20edited.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:
Use <code>find_student</code> command to filter the list of students you want.<br>

</ol>

![delete_student_result_example](images/enhao/delete_student_result%20-%20edited.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:
Similar to <code>edit_student</code>, you can also use <code>find_student</code> command to filter the list of students you want.<br>

</ol>

![emails_client_example](images/enhao/email_client-edited.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:
Similar to <code>edit_student</code>, you can also use <code>find_student</code> command after step 1 to filter the list of students you want.<br>
The email addresses displayed will be based on the current list.<br>
(E.g. If you only want the the email addresses of <code>Alex Yeoh</code>, <code>David Li</code> and <code>Roy Balakrishnan</code> from the sample data,
you can use <code>find_student Alex David Roy</code> and <code>emails</code>
to get the concatenated text of the 3 students' email addresses.)
</div>
