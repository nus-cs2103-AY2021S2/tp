### 2.2 Trying out

1. Let's try out your first command by adding a new property! Type <br>`add property n/Bishan t/Hdb a/Blk 150 Bishan Street 11 #02-101 p/570150 d/30-6-2021` into the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. After that, scroll down to the bottom of the property list to see your newly added property.

1. Now let's try adding a new appointment. Type <br>`add appointment n/Meet Jacob for dinner r/At Lot One's food court d/19-4-2021 t/1930` and hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> button. Scroll down to the bottom of the appointment list to see your newly added appointment.
1. Forgot when you are supposed to meet Simon again? Let's try finding out! Type <br>`find appointment simon` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. There it is! Your appointment with Simon is on Sep 20, 2021.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add property n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as <br>`add property n/Bishan`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add property n/NAME t/PROPERTY_TYPE a/ADDRESS p/POSTAL_CODE d/DEADLINE [r/REMARKS] [cn/CLIENT_NAME] [cc/CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER] [ce/CLIENT_EMAIL] [ca/CLIENT_ASKING_PRICE] [tags/TAGS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS]` can be used as <br>`add property n/Bishan t/Hdb a/Blk 150 Bishan Street 11 #02-101 p/570150 d/30-6-2021` <br> or as <br>`add property n/Bishan t/Hdb a/Blk 150 Bishan Street 11 #02-101 p/570150 d/30-6-2021 r/Urgent to sell cn/George cc/91124788 ce/george_4788@gmail.com ca/$750,000 tags/Urgent, 4 bedrooms`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[OPTION]...` can be used as `pl/$1,000,000`, `pl/$1,000,000 t/Condo` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME r/REMARKS`, `r/REMARKS n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/The Mayfair n/Mayfair`, only `n/Mayfair` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## 7. Appendix

### 7.1 Launching application via command line

For advanced users, it is also possible to launch the app via the command line. Doing so will allow you the option of specifying your own configuration file.  The configuration file can be used to specify the location of the preferences file, which contains the preferred storage file paths for both property and appointment data.

The default file paths used are:

* Configuration file: `[JAR file location]/config.json`
* Preferences file: `[JAR file location]/preferences.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** However, if the specified configuration file or the preferences file is in an incorrect format, the default file paths will be used.
</div>

To launch PocketEstate via the command line,

1. First, open up your command prompt or terminal.
1. Then, `cd` into the base directory containing the `pocketestate.jar` file.
1. Run `java -jar pocketestate.jar --config={path_to_config_file.json}`, replacing `{path_to_config_file.json}` with your own JSON configuration file.<br>
E.g. `java -jar pocketestate.jar --config=myConfigFile.json`
