## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addNote c/CONTENT`, `CONTENT` is a parameter which can be used as `addnote c/This is a note`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listcommand`, `exit` and `clearcontact`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Extraneous parameter for commands that only take in one parameters (such as `open`, `close`, and `setdividerc` will **not** be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `open -c 123`, the command will be invalid.

## FAQ

**My data is missing after I edited my JSON file.**
* When an invalid JSON file is detected, Dictionote discards all data and starts over with an empty data file. 
* Please use a JSON editor software to ensure that the format is still valid after you've edited it.

**I tried to open the closed panel with my mouse, but there is no content displayed when I drag the panel open.**
* Dictionote currently does not allow user to change the visibility of the panel using mouse, 
  please use the `open` command instead.

**How do I contribute to the project? I have added some new dictionary content and definitions.**
