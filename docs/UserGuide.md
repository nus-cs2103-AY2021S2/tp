App-Ointment is a **desktop app for managing and scheduling patient appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, App-Ointment can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `App-Ointment.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your App-Ointment App.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI, similar to the image shown below, should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list-appt`** : Lists all the appointments in the appointment schedule.

   * <code><b>add-patient</b> n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01</code> : Adds a patient to the patient records.

   * <code><b>delete-appt</b> 3</code> : Deletes the 3rd appointment from the displayed appointment schedule.

   * **`clear-appt`** : Clears all appointments in the appointment schedule

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters with prefixes (e.g. `n/`, `p/`, `t/`) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command format specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, and you specified it multiple times instead, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Where a parameter is not expected in the command, and you specified it, it will either be ignored, or included as part of the previous parameter.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/Doctor Who p/12341234` in `add-doctor` where the phone parameter is not expected, the app will interpret it as adding a doctor with name `Doctor Who p/12341234`, which is not allowed.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `clear-appt`, `clear-doctor`, `clear-patient`, `exit`, `help`, `list-appt`, `list-doctor` and `list-patient`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: <b>Tip:</b>

Format: `clear-patient`

* Entries in the patient records can only be cleared if there are no existing appointments in the appointment schedule. <br>
* Otherwise, `clear-appt` will have to be called first. <br>
* The above-mentioned requirements are similarly applicable to [`clear-doctor`](#clearing-all-entries-in-doctor-records-clear-doctor)

### Deleting a patient : `delete-patient`

Examples:
* `list-patient` followed by `delete-patient 3` deletes the 3rd patient in the patient records.

![result for 'help'](images/helpMessage.png)

### Entering an Invalid Command:
Entering an invalid command will result in the app throwing an exception, and prompting the user the closest known command, based on the smallest `minimum edit distance` (minimum amount of additions, deletions, and replacements). 

This feature is meant for identifying typographical errors, and as such, no other form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used. If the edit distance is too much (above 10 edits), `Unknown command` will be displayed.

![result for ''](images/InvalidCommandMessage.png)

Examples:
* `delete-appppt` prompts `delete-appt`
* `list` prompts `exit`
* `too-long-command` returns `Unknown command`

### Toggle User Inputs: <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd>&darr;</kbd>
Format: <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd>&darr;</kbd>

Toggles between previous inputs keyed into the Command Box previously. Returns user to a *blank* Command Box upon keying <kbd>&darr;</kbd> on the most recent input.

### Saving the data

App-Ointment data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

App-Ointment data are saved as 3 JSON files:
`[JAR file location]/data/PatientRecords.json`
`[JAR file location]/data/DoctorRecords.json`
`[JAR file location]/data/AppointmentSchedule.json`
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data files.
Do note that adding entries into the patient and doctor records will require a UUID Version 4 generator.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <b>Caution:</b>
If your changes to the data files makes its format invalid, App-Ointment will discard the data file that is invalid and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div><br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous App-Ointment home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
