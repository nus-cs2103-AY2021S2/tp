## Introduction
**SunRez** is a desktop app designed for college residential staff to efficiently manage student housing services. It 
features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

**SunRez** has the following features:
* Keeps track of maintenance issues
* Keeps track of student records
* Keeps track of room records

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `sunrez.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SunRez.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. A GUI like the one pictured below should appear in a few seconds.
   Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

    * `rlist`: Lists all residents.

    * `radd n/Joseph Tan p/84666774 e/e0103994@u.nus.edu y/2`:
      Adds a resident named `Joseph Tan` with phone number `84666774`, email `e0103994@u.nus.edu`, a 2nd year student.

    * `rdel 3`: Deletes the 3rd resident shown in the current resident list.

    * `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SunRez User Interface (UI)
The following image shows the different parts of the SunRez application window:

![Ui Layout](images/UiLayout.png)

### Using the UI

SunRez is optimized for fast typists, so most input to SunRez takes the form of commands. To execute a command, 
simply type it into the **Command Box** then press `ENTER` on the keyboard. The result (or an error message) will be
displayed in the **Result Box** following a command execution. Details about specific commands can be found in the 
[features](#features) section.

An error message may be shown for various reasons. Most commonly, one is shown if a command cannot be parsed (that is,
if SunRez cannot understand the format of your command) or if a command has been given parameters which are out of
the acceptable range. In the following sections, more information is given about acceptable 
[command formats](#command-format), [command parameters](#command-parameters), and the 
[command parsing process](#command-parsing). 

### Command Format

Commands in this user guide follow this format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `radd n/NAME ...`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `radd n/John Doe ...`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `d/DESCRIPTION [t/TIMESTAMP]` can be used as `d/Broken chair t/2020/3/23 11:59pm` or as `d/Broken chair`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence 
  of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John Doe n/Jane Doe`, only `n/Jane Doe` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `ilist`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
### Command Parsing

#### Repeated parameters
All commands in SunRez default to taking the latest occurrence of a duplicate parameter **except [tags](#tag)**. 
For example, if you key in this command:

`radd n/John Doe n/Timmy Tan p/91234567 e/e0123456@u.nus.edu y/3`

The resident's name will take the **later** occurrence of name and create a resident named "Timmy Tan".

On the other hand, **all** [tags](#tag) specified will be taken. 

For instance, `radd n/John Doe n/Timmy Tan p/91234567 e/e0123456@u.nus.edu y/3 g/tag_one g/tag_two g/tag_three` will 
create a resident with tags `tag_one`, `tag_two` and `tag_three`.


#### Interpreting parameter values
Commands in SunRez have a pre-set parameter list they accept. The value for the parameter will be all characters 
until the next occurrence of a parameter prefix for the command.
For example, if you key in this command:

`radd n/John Doe p/91234567 e/e0123456@u.nus.edu y/3`

The resident's name will be all characters that follows `n/` until just before the start of `p/`, including the space. 
Most commands, however, trim leading and trailing spaces.

Let us break this down further and assume `radd` only takes in 2 parameters for the purposes of explanation. 
We can break the command down as follows:

`radd n/[NAME_STRING] p/[PHONE_NUM_STRING]`

A user can enter a `NAME_STRING` that consists of anything, including text that contains prefix-like strings such as `s/`. 
For example, a user could enter `John s/o Tom`. 
However, as `s/` is not a valid prefix for the `radd` command, the command parser will treat `John s/o Tom` as the 
value for the name parameter. 


The validation for the `Name` parameter will process `John s/o Tom` and may reject it based on the stated validation rules.
However, a known limitation of this approach is that parameter values containing valid parameter prefixes will cause issues. 

Let us take a look at another example:

If `NAME_STRING` = `John p/ Tom`, the command keyed in could look like `radd p/[VALID_PHONE_NUM] n/John p/ Tom` 
(Remember that prefix order does not matter.) 

This will create the presence of 2 phone number parameters. In such a case, the latter value will be taken. 
As `Tom` is not a valid phone number, it will be rejected.

#### Interpreting errors

In most cases, the error displayed should be relatively self-explanatory. This sub-section aims to clear up any ambiguity 
you might encounter when dealing with invalid commands or errors. 

We will break our explanation down into the following categories:
- Incorrect formats
- Parameters do not conform to required values
- Commands that require an [`INDEX`] (e.g. `redit 1 n/John`)

##### Incorrect formats
This error typically shows a message along the following lines: `Invalid command format! [Information on how to use
the command]`

![Invalid command format](images/error-invalid-cmd-format.png)

Typically this happens because the command does not match the required format. Check if you are missing any parameters.
A special case of this takes place when the `INDEX` value is not a number.

##### Parameters do not conform to required values
This error typically shows a message along the following lines: `[Parameter name] must be [some condition]`. E.g. 
`Room numbers should be formatted as such: XY-ABC, where XY can be any pair of digits except 00, and ABC can 
be any 3 digits.`

![Invalid param format](images/error-invalid-param-format.png)

Typically this happens because the parameter provided does not match the required format. Check if your parameter conforms
to the format stated under the [command parameters](#command-parameters) section. The error message usually gives some
helpful information in resolving the error too.

##### Commands that require an `INDEX`
The bounds of the `INDEX` parameter is documented [below](#index). This section will explain how errors with the `INDEX`
will be dealt with.

- If you do not specify the `INDEX` (e.g. `rdel`): The app will inform you that the format is invalid, and display the 
  format that should be used. This is a specific case of [incorrect formats](#incorrect-formats).
  
- If the `INDEX` is not an integer (e.g. `rdel abc`): The app will inform you that the format is invalid, and display the
  format that should be used. This is also a specific case of [incorrect formats](#incorrect-formats), as the command 
  expects a number but did not get one.

- If the `INDEX` parameter is required alongside other parameters e.g. [`redit`](#edit-a-resident-record--redit), and
  **only** an `INDEX` (be it valid or not) value is provided (e.g. `redit 1000` or `redit 1`): The app will inform you
  that the format is invalid, and display the format that should be used. This is another specific case 
  of [incorrect formats](#incorrect-formats), as the command compulsorily needs at least one of the optional parameters 
  to be provided.
  
- If the `INDEX` is 0 or lesser (e.g. `rdel -5`): The app will inform you that `INDEX` should be a positive integer.

![Index non positive](images/error-idx-non-positive.png)

- If the `INDEX` is above the range of the collection specified (e.g. `rdel 100` but there are only 6 residents): The 
  app will inform you that `INDEX` needs to be between 1 and the size of the collection in question.

![Index out of range](images/error-idx-out-of-range.png)

### SunRez Data Files

SunRez main application data and command history are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command
that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Undo/redo history

Undo/redo history is not saved to the hard disk, so it will be lost when SunRez is exited.

#### Edit the data files

* SunRez main application data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR_file_location]/data/sunrez.json`.
* SunRez command history is saved as a plain-text file `[JAR_file_location]/data/commandhistory.txt`.
    * Each command history entry is a single line in the file.
    * The entire command history can be cleared by simply deleting the contents of the command history file.

Advanced users are welcome to edit these files directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
**Caution**: <br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SunRez will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
