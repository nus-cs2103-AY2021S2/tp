## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `dark`, `light` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Commands will only handle `INDEX` values from 1 to 2147483647 (inclusive). This number represents the largest possible number of contacts
  that can be stored using the current implementation of SpamEZ.
  Values out of this valid integer range will be treated as invalid inputs.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the app limitations:**<br>

* Names can only include alphanumeric characters.

* Phone numbers can only contain numbers.
  
* Uniqueness of each contact is decided by their email. As such, no 2 contacts can share the same email.

* Tags cannot contain spaces.

* The following images represent email, phone and address respectively, which are the only 3 modes of contact supported.

### Listing all persons : `list`

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [m/MODE_OF_CONTACT] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. 
  The index **must be a valid positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Adding a remark : `remark`

Adds an optional remark to a person in the address book.
If the person already has a remark, the existing remark will be replaced.

Format: `remark INDEX r/REMARK`

* Adds or replaces the remark of the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index
  refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a valid positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* By default, all newly added contacts will be displayed as having 'No remark'.
* You can remove a person's remark by typing `r/` without specifying any remark after it. This will cause the person
  to be displayed as having 'No remark' again.

Example:

* `remark 3 r/Currently on Stay Home Notice`

### Blacklisting or un-blacklisting a contact : `blist`

Blocks specific contacts, to specify that they do not want to be contacted.
If the contact is already blacklisted, they will be un-blacklisted. Blacklisted contacts are
displayed with a black background, as shown below.

![blacklisted contact](images/BlacklistedContact.png)

Format: `blist INDEX`

* Changes the blacklist status of the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index 
  refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a valid positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Example:

* `blist 1`

### Blacklisting or un-blacklisting multiple contacts : `massblist`

Blacklist or un-blacklist all contacts within the specified index range (inclusive).

Format: `massblist START-END b/BLACKLIST_OR_UNBLACKLIST`

* Changes the blacklist status of all contacts whose `INDEX` lies between the specified index range
  to either 'blacklist' or 'unblacklist' depending on the input parameter.
* The keyword (`blacklist` and `unblacklist`) must be in lower case. 
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. Both the 
  start index and end index **must be valid positive integers** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Start index must be strictly smaller than the end index and the end index cannot be larger than the number of contacts
  currently displayed in the list.
* The index range must be specified before the keyword. <br>
  e.g. `massblist b/blacklist 4-5` is treated as an invalid input.

Example:

* Suppose you start with the following contact list:
  ![massBlacklist1](images/massBlacklist1.png)
  Executing `massblist 1-3 b/blacklist` will blacklist the first three contacts. Since the second contact is already
  blacklisted, it remains the same. <br>

Format: `delete INDEX`

### Collecting details from contacts : `collect`

The type of detail is specified by the prefix provided. Details will be separated
by the given separator, or by a semicolon if unspecified.
Collected details end with the separator to allow further manual addition of details.

Format: `collect [n/] or [p/] or [e/] or [a/] [s/SEPARATOR]`

* Exactly one of the type of detail prefix must be provided.
  The corresponding fields are as follows.
    * `n/`: Name
    * `p/`: Phone
    * `e/`: Email
    * `a/`: Address
* The separator will ignore leading and trailing spaces.
  As such, it is not possible to start or end the separator with a space.

Examples:

* `collect e/`

Format: `sort ASCENDING_OR_DESCENDING`

Format: `find [n/NAME_KEYWORDS] [t/TAG_KEYWORDS] [a/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS] [e/EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [p/PHONE_NUMBERS] [b/IS_BLACKLISTED] [m/MODE_OF_CONTACT]`

* At least one of the parameters must be included as the parameters.
* Parameters, if provided, may not be empty. In other words, commands such as `find n/` or `find n/abc t/` are invalid.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* For name, tag and address parameters, only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* For email and phone parameters, partial matches are allowed, e.g. for phone number, `8123` will match `81234567`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword of each provided attribute will be returned.
  e.g. `n/Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`, `Bo Hans`, while `n/Hans Bo t/friends` will only return `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang` if only `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang` are tagged with `friends`.
* Blacklist parameter (`b/`) only accepts `true` or `false`.
* Mode of contact parameter (`m/`) only accepts `phone`, `email` or `address`.
* Blacklist and mode of contact parameters only take in the first keyword. For example, if `b/true blah blah` is inputted, it will be interpreted as `b/true`.

Examples:

* `find n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find n/alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find n/alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)
* `find n/alex david t/family` returns `David Li`
