MeetBuddy is a **desktop app for managing contacts and daily meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, MeetBuddy can get your contacts and meetings management done faster than traditional GUI apps. In addition, MeetBuddy is meant for users to organise their meetups
with friends, family, or work colleagues. It provides a better user experience for users who have alot of contacts having online Gravatar accounts, where there is automatic syncing of
their profile pictures.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[g/GROUP]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `g/friend`, `g/friend g/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME ph/PHONE_NUMBER`, `ph/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `ph/12341234 ph/56785678`, only `ph/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Note that for all date arguments, if the day is less than or equal to 31 and 
there is no such day corresponding to the given month and year of the date, the program is smart enough to handle 
 such cases and automatically corrects the date to the nearest valid end-of-month date. For example 
`31-02-2021` will be auto-corrected to `28-02-2021` because there is no such date. 
  But `32-02-2021` will not be autocorrected and the user will be prompted with an error message.
