Welcome to the User Guide of _Teaching Assistant_!

Are you a JC/Secondary school teacher, having troubles keeping track of all your consultations, meetings and your
students' contacts? No worries! Our application, _Teaching Assistant_ will provide an all-in-one platform for you to
organise your entries (tasks and schedules) and contacts!

We target JC/Secondary school teachers as they are the teachers who have a greater need to contact their students
compared to primary school schools, yet do not have a standardised platform for communication unlike teachers
in tertiary schools.

_Teaching Assistant_ mainly uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). This means that a user can use the application by
typing into a Command Box. For users who type fast, they can use this application more efficiently than other
applications that heavily use Graphical User Interface (GUI), where a user uses the application by interacting with
graphical features such as buttons.

If you are interested, jump to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to learn how to learn how to start using _Teaching Assistant_
.

## Features

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. in `cadd n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which
  can be used as `cadd n/John Doe`.
* Items in the square brackets are optional. Users can choose to leave the field empty.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `  ` 
  (i.e. 0 times), t/friend, t/friend t/family etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
  acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken. e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored. e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
