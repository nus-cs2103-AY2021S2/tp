Vax@NUS is a **one stop management app to efficiently track and schedule COVID-19 vaccinations for NUS students.** It is a desktop app **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Vax@NUS can get your appointment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: NOTE ABOUT THE COMMAND FORMAT :**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/SCHOOL RESIDENCE]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/RC4` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
    
* Prefixed parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
* If a prefixed parameter is expected only once in the command but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
   
* Parameters without prefix must strictly adhere to the order shown in the command.<br>

 :information_source: **NOTE:**  Vax@NUS will display our sample data file if no data file is found from your computer.

### Editing the data

Vax@NUS data is saved as a JSON file [JAR file location]/data/studentbook.json. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> Please refer to the [Input Formats](#input-formats) section when editing the data file to conform to the required format.

Editing a student's matriculation number through the JSON file is allowed, however, extra care must be taken to ensure data integrity. 

If you change a student's matriculation number, you must also update the matriculation number for the corresponding student's appointment. 
Failure to do so will result in an invalid data file format as the appointment does not belong to any student. 

> :warning: If your direct changes to the data file result in invalid data formatting, Vax@NUS will discard all data and start with an empty data file in your next launch. Be very careful!
