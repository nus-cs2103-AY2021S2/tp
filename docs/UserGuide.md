## Introduction
SOChedule is a one-stop solution for NUS School of Computing (SoC) students to manage their tasks and events effectively.
Targeted at users who can type fast and prefer typing to mouse input, SOChedule is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `SOChedule.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SOChedule.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. A sample SOChedule is given below. There would not be pre-entered data on first launch so that users can immediately jump in and use.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list_task`** : Lists all tasks.

   * **`add_task`**`n/CS2103 assignment d/2021-04-07 p/1 c/schoolwork t/urgent` : Adds a task named `CS2103 assignment` to the SOChedule with its respective attributes. Please verify the validity of the date parameter.

   * **`delete_task`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `undone_task INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `undone_task 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TASKNAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Quiz t/CS2103` or as `n/Quiz`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/1 p/2`, only `p/2` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list_task`, `list_event`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list_task 123`, it will be interpreted as `list_task`.

### Viewing help: `help`
Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.
![helpMessage](images/helpMessage.png)

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Adding a task: `add_task`
Adds a task into the task list.

Format: `add_task n/TASKNAME d/DEADLINE p/PRIORITY [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...`
* `n/` is followed by the task name, it is case-sensitive.
* `d/` is followed by the date of deadline, with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, deadline cannot be a past date. Here, `Y` means
  the year, `M` means the month and `D` means the day and all of them has to be integers and the date must be a valid date.
* `p/` is followed by the priority, with 0 being highest and 9 being lowest. Other inputs are not accepted.
* `c/` is followed by the category. Different categories are separated by white space. It is optional.
* `t/` is followed by the tag. Different tags are separated by white space. It is optional.
* Note that any valid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. n/Homework 1 or p/1) followed by invalid prefixes and input arguments
  (e.g. name/Name, tag/Tag or T&sk) will lead to an error.

Examples:
* `add_task n/CS2103 assignment d/2022-02-27 p/1 c/schoolwork t/urgent` adds a new task named "CS2103 assignment" with the respective parameters.
* `add_task n/CCA admin work d/2022-02-28 p/2 c/CCA` adds a new task "CCA admin work" with the respective parameters.

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Deleting a task: `delete_task`
Deletes a task from the task list.

Format: `delete_task INDEX`
* Deletes the task at the specified INDEX.
* Note that only one `INDEX` is accepted, multiple `INDEX` will lead to input format error.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the **displayed** task list.
* The `INDEX` must be a positive and valid integer 1, 2, 3, ... i.e. `0`, negative integers and integers greater than
  `2147482637` will lead to input format error.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete_task 2` deletes the second task in the full task list.
* `find_task homework` followed by `delete_task 1` deletes the first task in the result of the `find_task` command.

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Editing a task: `edit_task`
Edits an **existing and uncompleted** task in the task list.

Format: `edit_task INDEX [n/TASKNAME] [d/DEADLINE] [p/PRIORITY] [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...`
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. 
  The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. 
  The index must be an **integer larger than zero**. A valid example can be `1`.
* You can only edit an **existing and uncompleted** task.
* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* The `DEADLINE` provided cannot be earlier than today.
* When editing tags/categories, the existing tags/categories of the task will be removed i.e. adding of tags/categories is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the task’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
  Similarly, you can remove all the task’s categories by typing `c/` without specifying any categories after it.
* If the index provided is a negative integer or zero, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.
* If the index provided is larger than `2147483647`(i.e. larger than the maximum value of `Integer` object in Java),
  it is not a valid integer in our definition.
  Thus, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.
* If the edited task is the same as the original task or the edited task is
  equivalent to another existing task in the task list, error messages will be shown.
  Same tasks means the name, priority, deadline, tags (if any) and categories (if any) of two tasks are equal.
* When editing tags, the order of tags given in the input and the order of tags shown in the UI can be different. 
  For example, in input `edit_task 1 t/tag1 t/tag2`, `t/tag1` is before `t/tag2`, 
  but `tag2` may appear in the UI before `tag1`, then `tag1` on the right of `tag2`. 
  The ordering is not guaranteed and this is intended behaviour.

Examples:
* `edit_task 1 n/t1` edits the name of the first task (if present in SOChedule) to be `editedTaskName`.
* `edit_task 2 p/3 t/` edits the priority of the second task (if present in SOChedule) to be `3` and clears all existing tags.

### Listing all tasks: `list_task`
Lists all tasks from the task list.

Format: `list_task`

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Marking one or more tasks as done: `done_task`
Marks one or more task from the task list as completed.

Format: `done_task INDEX1 [INDEX2] ...`
* Marks the task(s) at the specified INDEX(es) as complete. 
  The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
  The index must be an **integer larger than zero**. A valid example can be `1`.
* When multiple indexes are provided, they need to be separated by a whitespace, e.g. `1 2`.
* All specified tasks must be **uncompleted and existing** before calling this command.
* If more than 1 indexes are provided, these indexes **cannot contain duplicates**. 
  Otherwise, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.
* If the index provided is a negative integer or zero, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned. 
* If the index provided is larger than `2147483647`(i.e. larger than the maximum value of `Integer` object in Java), 
  it is not a valid integer in our definition. 
  Thus, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.
* If indexes provided include both an index for a task not existing in task list and an index for a completed task,
  the error message will only be about the non-existing task.

Examples:
* `done_task 1 2` marks the first and second task in the task list as completed.

#### Illustration of usage of `done_task`:
![Example of usage of `done task`](images/DoneTaskUsage.png)

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Marking a task as uncompleted: `undone_task`
Marks a completed task from the task list as uncompleted.

Format: `undone_task INDEX`
* Marks the task at the specified INDEX as uncompleted.
  The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
  The index must be an **integer larger than zero**. A valid example can be `1`.
* The specified task must be completed before calling this command.
* If the index provided is a negative integer or zero, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.
* If the index provided is larger than `2147483647`(i.e. larger than the maximum value of `Integer` object in Java),
  it is not a valid integer in our definition.
  Thus, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.

Examples:
* `undone_task 1` marks the first task in the task list as uncompleted.

#### Illustration of usage of `undone_task`:
![Example of usage of `undone task`](images/UndoneTaskUsage.png)

### Getting today's tasks: `today_task`
Lists all tasks that have deadline on today from the task list.

Format: `today_task`

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Finding tasks by name: `find_task`
Finds tasks whose names contain any of the given keywords from the task list.

Format: `find_task KEYWORD1 [KEYWORD2] ...`
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `homework` will match `Homework`.
* The search scope is the **full** task list.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Practice Problems` will match `Problems Practice`.
* Only the name of the tasks is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `CS` will not match `CS2103`.
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `CS2103 Homework` will return
  `ST2131 Homework`, `CS2103 Quiz`.

Examples:
* `find_task Homework` returns `st2131 homework` and `Homework 1`
* `find_task assignment homework` returns `Assignment 1`, `Homework 2`
  
![find_task example](images/find_task-example.png)

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Sorting all tasks: `sort_task`
Sorts the task list.

Format: `sort_task ARGUMENT`
* Sorts task list and updates UI based on supplied argument.
* Accepted arguments (case-sensitive):
   * `name`: Sorts by task name, in increasing lexicographical order
   * `deadline`: Sorts by task deadline, in increasing date order
   * `completion`: Sorts by task completion status, with completed tasks at the bottom
   * `priority`: Sorts by task priority, in decreasing order, from priority 0 on top, to priority 9 at the bottom
* On subsequent boots, the following will happen:
   * Relative order from previous launch will be preserved.
   * However, if any order-altering command is issued, tasks will be sorted by name by default, unless otherwise stated by another `sort_task` command.
    
Examples:
* `sort_task completion` sorts the task list by completion status.
* `sort_task name` sorts the task list by name.

#### Illustration of usage of `sort_task`:
![Example of usage of `sort_task`](images/SortTaskUsage.png)


[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Pinning a task: `pin_task`
Pins a task from the task list.

Format: `pin_task INDEX`
* Pins the task at the specified INDEX.
* Already pinned tasks will be unable to be pinned a second time.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index must be a positive and valid integer 1, 2, 3, ...
* After pinning, the Task List will be sorted either according to previously entered `sort_task` command, or name (by default). See [here](#illustration-of-the-interaction-between-pin_task-and-sort_task).
    * Should there be two or more pinned tasks, the pinned tasks will be sorted as well.
    * Only the fact that pinned tasks will appear over the unpinned tasks is guaranteed. Internal order of pinned tasks is not persistent over `sort_task`.
* Pinned tasks are persistent over instances of SOChedule.

Examples:
* `pin_task 1` pins the first task in the task list

#### Illustration of usage of `pin_task`:
![Example of usage of `pin_task`](images/PinTaskUsage.png)

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Unpinning a task: `unpin_task`
Unpins a task from the task list.

Format: `unpin_task INDEX`
* Unpins the task at the specified INDEX.
* Follows similar restrictions to `pin_task`

Examples:
* `unpin_task 1` unpins the first task in the task list

#### Illustration of usage of `unpin_task`:
![Example of usage of `unpin_task`](images/UnpinTaskUsage.png)

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Clearing completed tasks: `clear_completed_task`
Clear tasks marked as completed from the task list.

Format: `clear_completed_task`
* If there's no completed task in the list (or even no any task in the list), this command is still able to be executed
and return success message `Completed tasks (if any) have been cleared!` (In this case, no task is cleared since no task is completed.)

#### Illustration of usage of `clear_completed_task`:
![Example of usage of `clear_completed_task`](images/ClearCompletedTaskUsage.png)

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)


### Clearing expired tasks: `clear_expired_task`
Clear tasks with past deadlines from the task list.

Format: `clear_expired_task`
* For a task to be considered expired, the task should have past deadline compare to the local date on the user's computer, 
hence changing of date on a computer could affect the judgement of expiration.
* If there's no expired task in the list (or even no any task in the list), this command is still able to be executed
and return success message `Expired tasks (if any) have been cleared!` (In this case, no task is cleared since no task is expired.)

### Finding events by name: `find_event`
Finds events whose names contain any of the given keywords from the event list.

Format: `find_event KEYWORDS [MORE_KEYWORDS]`
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `meeting` will match `Meeting`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Attending Lecture` will match `Lecture Attending`.
* Only the name of the events is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `CS` will not match `CS2103`.
* Events matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `CS2103 Meeting` will return
  `Project Meeting`, `CS2103 Lecture`.

Examples:
* `find_event Meeting` returns `project meeting` and `Research Meeting`.
* `find_event talk competition` returns `Career Talk`, `Coding Competition`

### Clearing expired events: `clear_expired_event`
Clears events with past end date time from the event list.

Format: `clear_expired_event`
* For an event to be considered expired, the event should have past end date time compare to the local time on the user's computer, 
hence changing of timing on a computer could affect the judgement of expiration.
* If there's no expired event in the list (or even no any event in the list), this command is still able to be executed
and return success message `Expired events (if any) have been cleared!` (In this case, no event is cleared since no event is expired.)

  i.e., ongoing events.
* Date entered must be a valid date and in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. `2021-04-01`. 
  It can be a date that is earlier than today.
* Only one single date can be entered. 
  If more than one dates are supplied, program will return an error message indicating invalid date format. 
  If no date is given, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.
* After running `find_schedule`, if you wish to view all existing tasks and all existing events, 
  please use the `list_task` and `list_event` respectively.

Examples:
* `find_schedule 2021-04-10` finds all existing uncompleted tasks with deadlines before or on the specified date
  and all existing events with start date before or on the specified date and end date after or on 
  before or on the specified date.
