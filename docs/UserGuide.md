Hello! Are you a parent whose phone's contact book is filling up with the contacts of teachers? Do you have trouble
remembering who exactly that contact in your contact book is referring to? Do you have multiple children and want
a centralised place to keep track of all their activities? Then HeliBook can be the app for you!

HeliBook is a **desktop app for managing your children's contacts and their related appointments, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, HeliBook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HeliBook.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: What's the difference between a Child Tag and a Tag? <br>
**A**: Child Tags are meant to represent your children, useful especially 
if you have multiple children. Child Tags will always appear at the front of the list of Tags
in the Address Book and are displayed in a different color to differentiate them. Any command
that works with regular tags such as 'Find' or 'Sort' will also work with Child Tags.
