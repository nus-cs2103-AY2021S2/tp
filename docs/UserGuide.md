## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.

1. Download the latest `docbob.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/releases).

1. Double-click the file to start the app. ![img_1.png](img_1.png)
   > **First Startup**: DocBob comes with some sample patient data when started for the first time. Try out the example commands below with the sample data and when you are ready, use the `clear` command to remove all sample patient data and start adding your own patients!

1. Execute commands by typing them in the command box and pressing **Enter**. See [Features](#features) for comprehensive details of each and every command.<br>
   Examples of commands:
   * **`list`** : Lists out all patients in DocBob's main patient list.

   * **`add n/Breanna Frye y/13121999 g/F p/97890525 e/example@gmail.com a/4340 Monroe Street b/AB+ h/163cm w/54kg`** : Adds a patient named `Breanna Frye` with the given information to the patient book.

   * **`appt 1 d/010120301200`** : Adds a scheduled appointment with the patient at index 1 in DocBob's main patient list, on 1st January 2030 12pm.
   
> **Quick tip**: typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will list out all available commands!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/cough` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Certain commands (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) do not take in parameters.  In cases like this, the extra input parameters will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Adding a patient's contact: `add`

Format: `add n/NAME y/DATEOFBIRTH g/GENDER p/PHONENUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS b/BLOODTYPE h/HEIGHT w/WEIGHT [t/TAG]`

* `NAME` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces and cannot be blank.
* `DATEOFBIRTH` should be in the form DDMMYYYY, be a valid date, and be in the past.
