## Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide (UG) of **SmartLib**!

Are you an owner of a private book loaning service or a library,
who is struggling to keep track of your readers' and books' records?
Do you frequently spend countless hours of your time trying to organize and manage the mountain of records generated by
your readers' borrowing activities?

If the above situation sounds familiar to you, fret not, for SmartLib is here to save the day!
SmartLib is a desktop application which would help you reduce the hassle of managing your business or library,
and save your valuable time.
It is an application optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
meaning that you will be operating the application by typing commands into a Command Box.
It also provides users with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
which is a feature that enables users to interact with the application through simple interactive graphics such as buttons.

If you can type fast, SmartLib would be a brilliant and efficient assistant in the systematic management of your books
and borrowers' information, as compared to the traditional GUI apps currently available in the market!

If you are interested in using our wonderful application,
head over to [quick start](#quick-start) now to learn how to begin your journey with SmartLib!

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `smartlib.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SmartLib.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
contains some sample data.<br><br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `listbook` and pressing Enter will
list all the current books in store.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `addreader r/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a reader named
   `John Doe` to SmartLib.

   * `deletereader 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `listbook` : Lists all stored books in SmartLib.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addreader r/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addreader r/John Doe`.<br><br>
  For more details regarding each parameter, you may want to explore
  [Readers' Command Parameters](#readers-command-parameters), [Books' Command Parameters](#books-command-parameters),
  and [Records' Command Parameters](#records-command-parameters).

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `r/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `r/John Doe t/VIP` or as `r/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/VIP`, `t/VIP t/MostFrequentCustomer`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `r/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER r/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence**
  of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

#### Adding a reader : `addreader`

You can use this command to add a new reader to SmartLib's registered reader base.

Format: `addreader r/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…`

**:information_source: Notes:**

* Refer to [Readers' Command Parameters](#readers-command-parameters) for more details about each parameter.
* Note that SmartLib uses reader names to identify a reader. Hence, duplicate names are not allowed.
* The reader's name is case sensitive, e.g. `Bob` and `bob` are two different readers.
* The `[t/TAG]…` parameters are optional.
  Duplicate tags will be ignored.

Example use:

Let's say a new reader wishes to be registered as a VIP.
You can follow the steps below to add the reader to SmartLib's registered reader list.

Steps:

1. Type `addreader r/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/vip` into the

  To delete a reader holding on to unreturned books, you will need to first return the books borrowed by the reader
  (see the [return command](#returning-a-book--return) for more details), before deleting him/her.

Example use:

#### Finding readers : `findreader`

##### By name:

You can use this command to find readers whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `findreader KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]…`

**:information_source: Notes:**

* Refer to [Readers' Command Parameters](#readers-command-parameters) for more details about each parameter.

* The search will only display readers whose name matches any of the keywords (i.e. it disregards tags,
  phone numbers, etc.).
* Readers matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

Example use:

Suppose you have many readers in your registered reader base, and you are trying to find a particular reader
which you could only remember as `Bob` (let's say you have forgotten his full name).
You can follow the steps below to obtain a list of readers named Bob.

Steps:

1. Type `findreader Bob` into the _Command Box_.
1. Press `Enter` to execute your input.

Outcome:

  phone numbers, etc.).
* Readers matching at least one tag will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `VIP VVIP` will return readers with either the tag `VIP` or with the tag `VVIP`.

Example use:

Let's say you have many readers in your registered reader base,
and you are trying to find more information about a particular type of reader(s) (e.g. VIPs).
You can follow the steps below to obtain a list of readers with the `VIP` tag.

Steps:

1. Type `findreader t/VIP` into the _Command Box_.
1. Press `Enter` to execute your input.

Outcome:

* The _Result Display_ will show a message with the number of matching results indicating success.

#### Adding a book : `addbook`

You can use this command to add a new book to SmartLib's registered book list.

Format: `addbook b/NAME a/AUTHOR p/PUBLISHER i/ISBN g/GENRE`

**:information_source: Notes:**

* Refer to [Books' Command Parameters](#books-command-parameters) for more details about each parameter.
* The book's name is case sensitive, e.g. `Secret` and `secret` are two different books.
* Note that SmartLib uses book ISBN to uniquely identify a unique edition and variation of a book. Hence,
  * There may be multiple copies of a book with the same name and ISBN.
  * Books with different names cannot share the same ISBN.
  * Books with the same name can have different ISBNs,
    as different authors may decide to publish books with the same name but with different content
    (e.g. _Great Expectations_, by Charles Dickens vs. _Great Expectations_, by Kathy Acker).
    
    In fact, in the event that the same author publishes two distinct books (i.e. different ISBN) with the same name,
    SmartLib will also be able to distinguish between them as well.

Example use:

Let's say you have ordered a new book (e.g. Harry Potter) for your library, and would like SmartLib to register the new
book.
You can follow the steps below to add the book to SmartLib's registered book list.

Steps:

1. Type `addbook b/Harry Potter a/JK Rowling p/Bloomsbury i/9780747532743 g/Fantasy` into the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute your input.

Outcome:

* SmartLib will randomly assign a barcode to your newly added book.
* The _Result Display_ will show a success message with the newly added book's information.

  keyword appears in the book's title, author, publisher, ISBN, or genre field).
* Books with information matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
