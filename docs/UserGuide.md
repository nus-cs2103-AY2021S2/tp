## Description

The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The Food Diary caters to food-passionate NUS students who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

The Food Diary will allow students to save time and effort when finding places to eat around the NUS vicinity. The Food Diary especially caters to students mainly on 4 aspects:

1. The ability for users to save food diary entries for future reference.
2. The ability for users to find entries based on specific fields.
3. The ability for users to have multiple food reviews for a food place.
4. The option for users to use Commands / UI to perform some tasks quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Interface

This section discusses the main semantics and purpose of the design of The Food Diary.

![Main Window UI](images/Ui.png)

ℹ️ Notes about the User Interface

* On start up of The Food Diary, users are greeted with the main window display.
 The main window displays all entries of the in The Food Diary on start up,
 in the order that the entries were added in.

### Main Window

* The main window features 5 components. From top to bottom, they are:
    1. A menu bar
    2. A command box text field
    3. A result display
    4. A list of entries
    5. A status bar

### Menu Bar
* The menu bar features 2 buttons: File, and Help.

* The File menu contains Exit, which when pressed, exits the app.

* The Help menu contains Help, which when pressed, opens a new Help window displaying all the a help guide for users.

### Command Box
* The command box is the text field users will type their commands in their in to use The Food Diary.

### Result Display
* The result display displays necessary logging information to the user.

* Information shown generally include the status of whether the command was written correctly syntactically,
 which would then allow for the app to perform the user's desired request.

* If the command cannot be interpreted by the app, the appropriate error message and corresponding rectification
 is displayed for the user to rectify their input command.

* The text field is also text-selectable.

### List of Entries
* This component features a list of entries currently stored in The Food Diary.

* A list of entries is autopopulated on start up, or when there is no existing data. To start afresh, use the `clear`
 function as stated below.

* Each entry displayed contains 5 compulsory fields, and 2 optional fields:
    1. Name of Restaurant
    2. Rating of Restaurant
    3. Price (an estimate) of the Restaurant's Food
    4. Address of Restaurant
    5. User's Review of the Restaurant
    6. (Optional) Food Categories (i.e. Cuisine, Restaurant/Food Characteristic etc.)
    7. (Optional) NUS School Location Categories

#### Consolidation of Entries
* Users need not add an extra entry if they wish to add on an extra review, or price pertaining to the same restaurant
 and location. A common situation involves users wanting to document their experience visiting the same restaurant
 more than once.

* As such, multiple reviews and prices pertaining to an entry can be added using the `addon` command. Refer to the
`addon` feature below for more information.

* An entry with multiple reviews only shows the first review, truncated with an ellipsis (...).

* This is done to keep each entry's window height short for the user to view more entries
 in within the main window.

* To view all the reviews pertaining to that entry, use the `view` command. Refer to the `view` feature below for
 more information.

* An entry with multiple prices shows a price range, ranging from the minimum to the maximum price
 among the prices added for the corresponding entry.


### Status Bar
* Displays the path directory information for the local storage file of The Food Diary.

### Help Window
* The help window shows a help guide for users on a separate window.

* The help guide has 3 main sections:
    1. A list of Commands
    2. A list of Food Categories
    3. A list of School Location Categories

* A list of commands gives a succint, convenient overview of all the commands executable
 in The Food Diary for the user.

* The Food and School Location categories aid users in learning what possible options they can tag their
 entries as in their commands.

* Users can copy the link with the `Copy URL` button, and view this User Guide for more information.

* Refer to the `help` feature below for more information.

### View & Revise Window

* These windows are described in detail in the `view` and `revise` features below respectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

ℹ️ Notes about the Command Format

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/Frontier.

* Items in angle brackets `<...>` are compulsory.

* Items in square brackets `[...]` are optional.
e.g `<n/NAME> [s/SCHOOL LOCATION]` can be used as `n/Subway t/UTOWN` or as `n/Subway` only.

* Items with `…​` (i.e an ellipsis) after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
e.g. `[c/CATEGORY] …​` can be used as `c/Fastfood c/Western c/Fastfood`, or 0 times etc.
e.g. `<KEYWORD> ...` means that there must be one keyword present in the command, and each keyword can take on
 any part of the entry as specified by the command (i.e. price, review etc.). See features for more understanding.

* Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `<n/NAME> <p/PRICE>`, then `<p/PRICE> <n/NAME>` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
e.g. if you specify `p/5 p/6`, only `p/6` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `[c/CATEGORY]`needs to be titled-cased, `[s/SCHOOL]` can be lower or upper-cased.

## FAQ

Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

A: Download the latest version of The Food Diary app in the other computer,
and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that
contains the data of your previous Food Diary home folder. The image below shows the file directory to get the 
`foodDiary.json` file, and where you should add it to if you would like the app to
read from the new data.
