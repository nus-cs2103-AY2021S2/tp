## Introduction

Are you tired of deciding what to wear every morning? Do you often
wonder whether your new clothing purchases would match your current wardobe? Have you ever misplaced your clothes?
Well, your journey to a better dressing experience starts today with **NuFash**.

**NuFash** is a **digital wardrobe desktop app for university students and/or those looking to
better organise their clothes**. The NuFash application allows users to input
their clothing items (garments) into their own digital wardrobe, and be able
to search through and match their various garments quickly. Some key features include:

- An easy-to-use digital wardrobe to manage your garments.
- A generated image to visually represent your garments in the wardrobe.
- Viewing functionality, to see certain pairing of garments.
- Selecting functionality, to keep track of when garments were used.
- Matching functionality, to suggest which garments could possibly be worn with each other.

The application is **optimised for use through the Command Line Interface (CLI)**, allowing users to quickly add or modify items
in their digital wardrobe. Our compact but powerful application also has a **integrated and easy to use Graphical User Interface(GUI)** 
providing a visual representation of a user's entire wardrobe catalogue in mere seconds!

This User Guide is for new users of the NuFash app to learn and understand what are the various features that NuFash 
has to offer. If you are interested in providing feedback on issues or would like to follow our development process, please visit our
[GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/)

**Use our application to reduce clutter and be empowered to make wiser clothing decisions today!**
