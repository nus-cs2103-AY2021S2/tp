Welcome to our website! _Teaching Assistant_ is a desktop application that helps **JC/Secondary school teachers** have an efficient tool to keep
track of their **contacts and other entries like tasks or schedules easily.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions
relies on typing commands as user inputs.

* If you are interested in using _Teaching Assistant_, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing _Teaching Assistant_, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
