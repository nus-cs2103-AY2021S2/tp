**Link.me is a desktop application built to help insurance agents manage their clients.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Link.me, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in the development of Link.me, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
