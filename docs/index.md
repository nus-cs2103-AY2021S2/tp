**RemindMe is a desktop app for keeping track of student's assignments, events and exams.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using RemindMe, head over to the [_Start-up_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
