**App-Ointment is an appointment management software for Receptionists of Medical Clinics**. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen through the usage of a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using App-Ointment, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
