**DietLAH! is a desktop application that allows users to easily track and maintain their meals so that they are able to maintain their ideal body weight.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using DietLAH!, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in helping to develop DietLAH!, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
