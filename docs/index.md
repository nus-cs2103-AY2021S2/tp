**TutorsPet is a desktop app designed for private tutors in Singapore to manage studentsâ€™ information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).**
TutorsPet helps improve the efficiency and effectiveness of student management by categorizing relevant contact information and keeping track of both lesson schedules and important dates.
