**NUS Module Planner is a desktop application for managing your study plans at NUS.** Users can create their own study plans to map out what modules to take for each semester so as to meet their graduation requirements. The application also highlights the pre-requisites for each module, to ensure that the user does not miss them out in their planning. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using NUS Module Planner, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NUS Module Planner, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
