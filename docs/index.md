**PartyPlanet is a desktop app for managing contacts, birthdays, and celebration plans** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
  Example usages:
  * Keep track of friends' contacts/birthdays
  * Record down important details to organise birthday celebrations easily
  * Quickly access contacts with upcoming birthdays

* It is named `PartyPlanet` because it will help you plan a party that’s **out of this world!**
* If you are interested in using PartyPlanet, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing PartyPlanet, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
