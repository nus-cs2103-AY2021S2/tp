**PawBook is a desktop application to help dog schools manage their daily operations.** 
While it has a GUI, user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using PawBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing PawBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
