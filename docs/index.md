**Car@leads is a desktop app for a car salesperson to manage customer contacts** (CLI).
<br> Users can add new customer contacts which include details such as customer's car brand and car type preferences along with other personal information.
<br> Users can filter through the customer data using specific filters, such as filtering out customers who prefer a specific car brand and follow up with them for sales opportunities.
<br> Car@leads is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
<br> If you can type fast, Car@leads can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
