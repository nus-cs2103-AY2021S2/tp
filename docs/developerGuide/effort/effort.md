### Difficulties and Challenges

The Difficulty level of implementing PartyPlanet was high, owing mainly to two reasons:

1. Refactoring the command set<br>
The previous command set had several redundancies. We thus refactored the entire command set to be more concise, cohesive and disjoint, condensing all the operations into the essential `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` (along with the event book equivalents) to support a more streamlined and consistent workflow. In order to create this new and improved command set, we had to think about which commands would facilitate a fast workflow for users. After determining the 4 main commands, we had to craft optional tags to these commands, to fine tune the effects of the command.

2. Implementing and integrating the event book<br>
The difficulty of implementing the event book is self-explanatory. Beyond that, we also had to integrate it properly and cohesively with the existing address book, so that PartyPlanet would feel like a refined product. This integration is facilitated by having both books appear on the same GUI, allowing users to easily cross reference the details of the CCA members or vendors, and then add planning remarks to the events being planned.

### Achievements of the project

* **Concise, cohesive command set:** The 4 main commands `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` (and the event book equivalents) all have non-overlapping and clear roles, which streamlines a userâ€™s workflow. Furthermore, the added options help fine tune the commands, augmenting the user-friendliness of our command set. Once a user is used to the command set and its additional options, this will facilitate effective and efficient party planning.

* **Cohesive product:** The address book and event books complement each other well, and offer users the ability to gather relevant details easily to plan for a celebration.

* **User friendly extras to streamline workflow:** From prompts when a command syntax is not recognized, to `undo` and `redo` commands for the occasional wrong command, the time taken for a user to correct any mistake made is minimized. PartyPlanet also provides keyboard shortcuts for `undo` and `redo`, and it includes an input history, accessed with the <kbd>UP</kbd> and <kbd>DOWN</kbd> arrow keys, for users to quickly use commands with a high degree of similarity. Finally, PartyPlanet has an autocomplete feature that helps users with editing the details of Persons and Events to reduce retyping majority of the details for a small change.
